# About Request Fulfillment

Request management (or request fulfillment) focuses on fulfilling Service Requests, which are often minor (standard) changes (e.g., upgrade RAM for physical machine) or requests for information (e.g., requests to change a password).

## Request Management Processes

### Request Fulfillment Support

Virima provides easy processes, skills and the rules to handle the service requests effectively and efficiently.

### Request Logging and Categorization

Authorized users can create a request using Request module. Relevant information regarding the nature of a request need to be added so that a full historical record is maintained – and if the request has to be referred to other support group(s), they will have the relevant information to assist them. All requests are fully logged and date/time stamped, regardless of whether they are raised through a Service catalog or whether created from a request module.

### Request Monitoring and Escalation

User can get status and progress information of a request by monitoring them. If an assignee or a Group assignee is unable to fulfill a request within given time frame based on SLA, then a request is said to be breached and it is escalated to the next level.

### Request Closure and Evaluation

The aim is to make sure that the Service Request is actually processed and that all information required describing the request's life-cycle is supplied in sufficient detail. In addition to this, findings from the processing of the request are to be recorded for future use.
