Use this function to import the required AWS resources into the Discovery application.

<!-- -->

- In the Name field, enter a name for the import action.

- In the Credential field, click the drop-down list and select the appropriate credential to access the AWS service.

  - If no credentials are listed in the dropdown, add credentials by navigating to <span class="Strong">Admin /> Discovery /> Credentials</span>.

<!-- -->

- Select all required services to be imported from the listed AWS services.

- <span class="inline-comment-marker">Click </span><span class="Strong">Add</span><span class="inline-comment-marker"> to import the AWS services to virima.</span>

  - User will be redirected to the import from AWS page, where the new import record will be shown with the Status as “<span class="Strong">Importing</span>”.

  - Once the status is “<span class="Strong">Completed</span>", Click on the imported record to view the imported AWS resources.

  - To view the details of the CI, click on the CI. This redirects you to the discovered item page, where you can view the imported CI details.

If you do not have the necessary permissions to import—such as lacking access to authenticate with a certificate or Secret Key —the system will display an error message:  
<span class="Strong">"Please check your AWS credentials."</span>
