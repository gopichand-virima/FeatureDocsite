# Overview

The **AD User Import Logs** feature in Virima provides administrators with a centralized interface to monitor and track the import of Active Directory (AD) user data. It ensures complete visibility into when imports are initiated, their completion status, and any potential irregularities that may occur during the process.

By maintaining a detailed, chronological record of user import activities, this feature supports **audit readiness, troubleshooting, and data accuracy**. Administrators can filter logs by name or date, quickly review import timelines, and access detailed information about each import event.
