# Client

The Discovery Application is installed in data centers to discover the host's communication in the Enterprise network. In the case of multiple data centers in different locations, the Discovery Application must be installed on one machine at every data center.

Every machine on which the Discovery Application is installed is referred to as a "Client," and each machine is added during the Virima installation process.
