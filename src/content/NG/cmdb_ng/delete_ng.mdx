# Delete

The [Delete]{.Strong} action enables the removal of selected CIs from the CMDB.

1. Click the [Select Actions]{.Strong} dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

2. Choose [Delete]{.Strong} from the dropdown.

3. Users must select at least one CI before triggering this action.

4. A confirmation prompt will appear to avoid accidental deletions.

- Click [Yes ]{.Strong}to confirm the deletion.

- Once deleted, the CI is removed from the active CMDB view and cannot be used in further operations.

**Note**: Use this option carefully, especially in production environments. Deleted CIs may need to be re-imported or rediscovered.
