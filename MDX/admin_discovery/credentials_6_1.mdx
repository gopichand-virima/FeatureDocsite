# Credentials

Use this function to enable the definition of authentication of the Server or other network components that helps to confirm their identity in a monitored network environment.

When Discovery attempts to access a device, it tries all available credentials until the correct ones are located. After identifying the credentials for a device, Discovery creates a mapping between the credentials and the device. All subsequent discovery activities attempt to match the credentials with a device for which an mapping exists. If credentials for a device change, Discovery tries all available credentials again until a new mapping is created.

In the main window, click **Admin > Discovery > Credentials**. The Credentials window displays. !
