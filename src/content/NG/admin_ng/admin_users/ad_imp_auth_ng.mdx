# AD Configuration

Use this function to create a new Active Directory configuration.

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks and is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.

## What is Active Directory

An AD domain controller authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Active Directory makes use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.

In the main window, click **Admin > Users > AD Configuration**. The AD Configuration window displays.

New AD Configuration

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **AD New Configuration**.

The **New** dialog box displays.

On the **Configuration** tab, fill in the values for the attributes.


By default, the Login Attribute is set to *userPrincipalName*.

When **Is Public** is selected, there is no *Client* field.


Click **Next**. The Map Properties tab displays.

Select (check) the fields that need to be imported, and map their values to that of an applicable AD property.

Click **Save**.

Testing AD Configuration

Open the **AD Configuration** line item**.**

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Test AD Configuration**.

If successful: The system confirms the AD configuration is valid.

If unsuccessful: An Alert Message will appear. For example:

“This discovery client is down. Please bring it up or select another discovery client.”

This means the configured discovery client is either not running or unavailable, and must be restarted or replaced.

If you have set the values of the attributes correctly as per your organization's AD structure, then the connection will be a success. Otherwise, it will fail.

Import Users

While Importing users into Virima , Virima looks whether a particular Location, Role, Designation, Department and Group is present, if not Virima creates one.

For consecutive AD imports, the value of a user gets updated if the value has been modified in the AD.

After AD configuration, do the following:

Click the **Import** icon to the right of the selected line item.

The AD Import dialog box displays.

For *Type of Import*, click the drop-down list and select the applicable option.

Select the other options, as necessary.

When all selections/entries are made, click **Import**.

A confirmation message displays. Click **OK**.

Scheduled AD Import

After AD configuration, do the following:

Click the **Schedule** **Import** icon to the right of the selected line item.

The Schedule AD Import dialog box displays.

Select *Enable Schedule* Import to turn on the import function.

Select *Activate User Account* to activate all users.

Select *Send completion notification* to the applicable users when the import is complete.

In the *AD Import Frequency* field, click the drop-down list and select the applicable import frequency, such as Every Day, Every 2 days, and so forth.

In the *Type of Import* field, click the drop-down list and select the type of import, such as All Users.

In the schedule area, select the appropriate timing.

When all selections/entries are made, click **Add**. (If you are editing the existing information, the **Add** button changes **Update**.)
