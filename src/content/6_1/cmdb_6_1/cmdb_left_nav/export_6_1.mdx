The <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Export</span> feature in CMDB allows users to download CI data in an Excel spreadsheet format. This is helpful for reporting, analysis, audits, or integration with external systems.

- Click the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions</span> dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

- Choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Export</span> from the dropdown.

There are two types of exports available:

# Basic export

- Quick, straightforward export.

- Includes only <span class="Strong">selected CI records</span>.

- Exports core CI properties as displayed in the CMDB list view.

- After initiation, a confirmation window appears. The system emails the user when the export file is ready.

Export time may vary depending on the number of CIs selected and data size.
