# IPAM Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for performing IP Address Management (IPAM) using Infoblox:

1.  <span class="Strong">Infoblox Configuration</span>  
    Configure Infoblox on the system to enable integration with IPAM for effective management of IP address resources.

    - Navigate to <span class="Strong">Admin /> Integration /> Infoblox Configuration</span>.

    - Set up the necessary Infoblox credentials: username, password, and host IP address.

    - Associate the credentials with the appropriate client in the system.

2.  <span class="Strong">IPAM</span>  
    After configuring Infoblox, use the IPAM functionality to manage and track IP addresses, subnets, and related network details.

    - Track the total number of subnets and IP addresses in each subnet.

    - Monitor and associate IP addresses with host names, hardware, and software information.

    - Periodically re-import resource definitions and configurations from Infoblox to maintain an accurate network inventory.
