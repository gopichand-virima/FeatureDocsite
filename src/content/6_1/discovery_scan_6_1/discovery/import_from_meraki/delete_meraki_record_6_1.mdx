- Deleting an item is permanent and cannot be undone. Understand the potential effects before deleting an item.

- Deleting an imported Meraki Import run will remove all corresponding discovered items from both the Import from Meraki page and the Discovered Items page.

- If any discovered items from the selected Meraki Import run have already been moved to the CMDB, those records will not be deleted—they will remain in the CMDB but will no longer appear in the Import from Meraki or Discovered Items pages.
