# Discovered Items: Components

Every configuration item has software and hardware associated with it. These components vary based on the [blueprint](/admin_sacm/blueprints_6_1.mdx).

When a new CI component is added, an email notification is sent to those Roles configured as per the SACM RACI matrix and email preferences.

To access the functions, do the following:

From the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan > Discovered Items.** The Discovered Items window displays.

Select a record in the list. A new windows displays with the Details tab selected by default.

Click the **Components** tab (if displayed). The applicable tabs and subtabs for the selected asset display.


Some tabs can be edited while others are view only. In addition, some tabs have sub-components.


To view a list of some available components, refer to [CI: Components List](/itsm/config_mngmt/components/ci_comp_list_6_1.mdx).
