# Overview

The **Imported Assets** page in Virima displays a list of assets that have been uploaded via file import (such as Excel or CSV). These assets have been processed by the system but are not yet in the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). They remain on this page until they are validated and moved to CMDB, re-scanned, or deleted.
