# Private Properties

The **Private Properties** tab in the Virima CMDB is designed for storing custom or sensitive asset attributes that may not be covered by standard fields. These properties are configured at the blueprint level, allowing organizations to tailor asset records to their unique requirements.

- Users can edit any private property and click **Save** to modify the changes.
