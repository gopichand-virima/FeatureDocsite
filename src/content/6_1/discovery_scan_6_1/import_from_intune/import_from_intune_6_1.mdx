# Overview

The [Import from Intune]{.Strong} feature in Virima allows organizations to seamlessly integrate Microsoft Intune resources into the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Rather than relying on traditional IP-range scans, this feature establishes a secure connection to Intune using credentials and APIs, ensuring an accurate and current inventory of managed devices and configurations.

By leveraging Intune's APIs and account permissions, Virima eliminates the need for dedicated discovery servers and enables automatic synchronization of assets. This streamlined approach enhances efficiency, reduces administrative overhead, and provides IT teams with comprehensive visibility into their Intune-managed environments.
