# About Problem Management

The Problem Management module provides comprehensive tools for identifying, analyzing, and resolving the root causes of incidents. This section covers the administrative configuration options available for problem management.

Problem Management in Virima enables organizations to:

- Identify and log problems (root causes of incidents)
- Investigate and analyze problems to find permanent solutions
- Track known errors and workarounds
- Link related incidents to problems
- Prevent recurring incidents through proactive problem management
- Generate reports on problem trends and resolution effectiveness

## Key Configuration Areas

The following administrative functions are available for Problem Management:

- **Problem Categories**: Define categorization schemes for problems
- **Problem Priorities**: Configure priority levels
- **Problem States**: Manage problem lifecycle stages
- **Problem Types**: Define different types of problems
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Configure RCA templates and methods
- **Closure Codes**: Define closure classifications
- **Known Error Database**: Manage known errors and workarounds
- **Problem Models**: Create reusable problem templates

Each of these areas can be configured to match your organization's specific problem management processes and ITIL best practices.

## Problem vs Incident

Understanding the distinction:

- **Incidents**: Focus on restoring service as quickly as possible
- **Problems**: Focus on identifying and eliminating root causes

Multiple incidents may be linked to a single underlying problem. Problem Management aims to prevent incidents from recurring by addressing their root causes.
