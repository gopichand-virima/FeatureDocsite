# Export

The [Export]{.Strong} feature in CMDB allows users to download CI data in an Excel spreadsheet format. This is helpful for reporting, analysis, audits, or integration with external systems.

- Click the [Select Actions]{.Strong} dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

- Choose [Export]{.Strong} from the dropdown.

There are two types of exports available:

# Basic export

![Configuration Management Database 12](../Resources/Images/CMDB - Left-Nav/Configuration Management Database_12.png)

- Quick, straightforward export.

- Includes only **selected CI records**.

- Exports core CI properties as displayed in the CMDB list view.

- After initiation, a confirmation window appears. The system emails the user when the export file is ready.

Export time may vary depending on the number of CIs selected and data size.

# Advanced export

- A customizable, multi-step export process.

- Allows users to:

 - **Select CI Blueprints** -- Choose which blueprint types (e.g., Windows Server, Software) to include.

 - **Select Properties** -- Choose specific fields (such as Asset Name, Status, and Serial Number) for export.

 - **Select Components** -- Include linked components, such as software instances and network adapters.

 - **Select Component Properties** -- Define which component properties should be included in the export.

Users can use all properties or filter by main properties to focus only on critical data fields.

Ideal for creating **detailed reports**, **audit packs**, or **custom views** tailored to specific stakeholders.
