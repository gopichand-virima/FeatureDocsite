# Incident Timescale

Use this function to configure response and resolution time targets based on incident priority levels.

Timescale settings define the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for incident response and resolution. These targets help ensure incidents are addressed within appropriate timeframes based on their priority.

In the main window, click **Admin > Incident Management > Incident Timescale**. The Incident Timescale window displays.

## Configure Timescale

The timescale configuration displays a matrix of priority levels and their associated time targets.

For each **Priority Level**, configure:

### Response Time

The maximum time allowed from when the incident is logged until the first response is provided.

Enter the response time in the following format:

- **Days**: Number of business days
- **Hours**: Number of hours
- **Minutes**: Number of minutes

Example: 0 days, 4 hours, 0 minutes = 4-hour response time

### Resolution Time

The maximum time allowed from when the incident is logged until it is resolved.

Enter the resolution time in the same format as response time.

Example: 1 day, 8 hours, 0 minutes = 1 business day and 8 hours

### Business Hours

Specify whether the timescale should use:

- **Business Hours**: SLA timers count only during defined business hours
- **Calendar Hours**: SLA timers count 24/7

Select the appropriate business hours calendar if using business hours.

## Priority Level Configuration

Configure timescales for each priority level:

| Priority | Typical Response Time | Typical Resolution Time | Description |
| P1 - Critical | 15-30 minutes | 4 hours | Critical business impact, immediate attention required |
| P2 - High | 1-2 hours | 8 hours | High business impact, urgent resolution needed |
| P3 - Medium | 4-8 hours | 2 business days | Moderate impact, standard resolution timeframe |
| P4 - Low | 1 business day | 5 business days | Low impact, can be scheduled as resources permit |
| P5 - Planning | 2 business days | 10 business days | Minimal impact, enhancement or future planning |
