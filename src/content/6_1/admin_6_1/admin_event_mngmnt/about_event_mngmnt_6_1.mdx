# About Event Management

Event Management provides effective service operation which depends upon knowing the status of the infrastructure and the components within. The purpose of event management is to manage events throughout their lifecycle, from detection through to determining the appropriate control action.

Monitoring and Event management are closely related but slightly different in nature. Event management focuses on generating and detecting meaningful notifications about the status of the IT infrastructure and services.

Monitoring simply watches the IT infrastructure and services, reporting on its status whether meaningful or not.

Events may be detected by a Configuration Item (CI) itself, or by a management tool polling the CI.

Any event detected may lead to an action being taken; the event could be acknowledged, may trigger an action or may lead to an Incident, Problem or Change being created.

Responses to events may be automated or may require manual intervention.


Admin functions are only available to System Administrators.
