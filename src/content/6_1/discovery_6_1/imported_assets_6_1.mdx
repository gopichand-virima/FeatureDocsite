        $prefix = $match.Groups[1].Value
        $path = $match.Groups[2].Value
        $ext = $match.Groups[3].Value
        
        # Convert path (hyphens to underscores, lowercase)
        $newPath = $path -replace '-', '_'
        $newPath = $newPath.ToLower()
        $newExt = $ext.ToLower()
        
        $fileReplacements++
        return "$prefix$newPath$newExt"
    )

Select at least one or more records. (When rescanning, the asset must have an IP address.)
