# Best approach for migrating CMDB data from legacy system?

Hi everyone,

We're planning to migrate our CMDB from a legacy system (ServiceDesk Plus) to Virima. Our environment includes:

- **~15,000 CIs** across multiple categories
- **Complex relationship mappings** between applications and infrastructure
- **Historical data** going back 5 years
- **Custom attributes** that may not have direct equivalents in Virima

## Questions

1. **What's the recommended migration strategy?** Should we do a full cutover or phased migration?

2. **Data cleanup** - Should we clean up the data before migration or use Virima's data quality features?

3. **Relationship preservation** - How do we ensure all CI relationships are maintained during migration?

4. **Testing approach** - What's the best way to validate the migrated data?

## Our Current Plan

We're thinking of:
- Exporting data to CSV
- Using Virima's bulk import API
- Running discovery to validate and enrich data
- Parallel running both systems for 2 weeks

Has anyone done a similar migration? Any lessons learned or recommendations?

Thanks in advance!
