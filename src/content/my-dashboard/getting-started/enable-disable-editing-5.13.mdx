# Enable/Disable Editing

Control edit mode for records and fields to prevent accidental changes and maintain data integrity.

## Overview

The Enable/Disable Editing function allows you to toggle between view and edit modes for records, forms, and fields. This feature helps prevent accidental modifications and provides a clearer distinction between viewing and editing data.

## Toggling Edit Mode

### Enable Editing
1. Open the record you want to edit
2. Click the **Edit** or **Enable Editing** button
3. Fields become editable (highlighted or with input boxes)
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save** to commit changes

### Disable Editing
1. While in edit mode, click **Cancel** or **Disable Editing**
2. Unsaved changes will be discarded (with confirmation)
3. Record returns to read-only view mode

## Edit Mode Indicators

### Visual Cues
When editing is enabled:
- Editable fields are highlighted or outlined
- Input fields become active
- Save and Cancel buttons appear
- Lock icon changes to unlocked state

### Status Messages
- **View Mode**: "Record is in view-only mode"
- **Edit Mode**: "Editing enabled - changes not saved"
- **Saving**: "Saving changes..."
- **Saved**: "Changes saved successfully"

## Field-Level Controls

### Read-Only Fields
Some fields remain read-only even in edit mode:
- System-generated fields (ID, created date)
- Calculated fields
- Auto-populated fields
- Fields requiring special permissions

### Conditional Editing
Certain fields may become editable based on:
- Record status or state
- User permissions
- Workflow stage
- Business rules

## Permission Controls

### Edit Permissions
Edit access is controlled by:
- User role and permissions
- Record ownership
- Team membership
- Administrative privileges

### Permission Levels
- **Full Edit**: Can modify all editable fields
- **Limited Edit**: Can modify specific fields only
- **No Edit**: View-only access
- **Conditional Edit**: Edit based on criteria

## Auto-Save vs. Manual Save

### Manual Save (Default)
- Changes are not saved until you click **Save**
- **Cancel** button discards all changes
- Confirmation prompt when navigating away with unsaved changes

### Auto-Save (If Enabled)
- Changes saved automatically as you type
- Reduced risk of data loss
- May have slight delay in saving
- Visual indicator shows save status

## Inline Editing

### Quick Edit Mode
- Edit records directly in list views
- Click a cell to edit inline
- Press Enter to save, Esc to cancel
- Tab to move between fields

### Bulk Editing
- Select multiple records
- Enable editing for all selected items
- Make changes across multiple records
- Save all changes at once

## Lock and Unlock

### Record Locking
When you enable editing:
- Record may be locked to prevent simultaneous edits
- Other users see "Locked by [username]" message
- Lock released when you save or cancel
- Timeout releases lock after inactivity

### Override Locks
Administrators can:
- View who has locked a record
- Override locks if necessary
- Force unlock stale locks
- Configure lock timeout duration

## Best Practices

- Always disable editing when done to prevent accidental changes
- Save changes frequently in long editing sessions
- Review changes before saving
- Use Cancel to discard unwanted changes
- Refresh the page if edit mode seems stuck
- Check for lock indicators before assuming you can edit
- Communicate with team when editing shared records
