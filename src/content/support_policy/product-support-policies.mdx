## Service Availability

### Platform Uptime Commitment

Virima commits to the following service availability levels for the SaaS platform:

| Subscription Tier | Monthly Uptime SLA | Annual Uptime SLA | Service Credits |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Enterprise** | 99.99% | 99.95% | Yes |
| **Professional** | 99.9% | 99.9% | Yes |
| **Standard** | 99.5% | 99.5% | Limited |

### Uptime Calculation

**Service Availability** is calculated as:

```
Uptime % = ((Total Minutes in Month - Downtime Minutes) / Total Minutes in Month) × 100
```

**Excluded from Downtime Calculation:**
- Scheduled maintenance windows (communicated 72 hours in advance)
- Emergency security maintenance (communicated as soon as practicable)
- Force majeure events
- Customer-caused outages or configuration issues
- Third-party service provider outages beyond Virima's control

### Service Credit Schedule

If Virima fails to meet the applicable SLA, customers are eligible for service credits:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit (% of Monthly Fee) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 99.0% - 99.9% | 10% |
| 95.0% - 98.99% | 25% |
| 90.0% - 94.99% | 50% |
| Below 90.0% | 100% |

> **Note:** Service credits must be requested within 30 days of the incident. Credits are applied to future invoices and do not exceed 100% of monthly fees.
