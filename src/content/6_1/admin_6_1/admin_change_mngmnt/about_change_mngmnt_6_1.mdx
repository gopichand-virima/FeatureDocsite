# About Change Management

The Project Change Management Process is followed during the Execution phase of the Project Management Life Cycle, once the project has been formally defined and planned.

## What is a Change Management Process

A Change Management Process is a method by which changes to the project (e.g. to the scope, deliverables, timescales or resources) are formally defined, evaluated and approved before implementation. The process entails completing a variety of control procedures to ensure that, if implemented, the change will cause minimal impact to the objectives of the project.

A Change Management Process is used to ensure that every change identified is formally:

<div class="Bullet1">

Communicated

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Documented

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Reviewed

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Approved

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Implemented

</div>

## When to Use a Change Management Process

Any change to the project during the Execution phase will need to be formally managed as part of the Change Management Process. Without a formal Change Management Process in place, the objective of delivering a solution within ‘time, cost and quality’ may be compromised.

The Change Management Process is terminated only when the Execution phase of the project is completed (for example, before Project Closure).

## Change Management Process

The Change Management Process is undertaken to ensure that each change introduced to the project environment is appropriately defined, evaluated and approved before implementation.

Change Management will be introduced to this project through the implementation of five key processes:

<div class="Bullet1">

The submission and receipt of change requests.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The review and logging of change requests.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The determination of the feasibility of change requests.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The approval of change requests.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The implementation and closure of change requests.

</div>

The following diagram describes the roles, processes and procedures to be undertaken to initiate, implement and review the effects of changes within the project.

### Identify and Submit Change Request

This process provides the ability for any member of the project team to submit a request for a change to the project. The Change Requester:

<div class="Bullet1">

Identifies a requirement for change to any aspect of the project (e.g. scope, deliverables, timescales and organization)

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Completes a Request For Change (RFC) and distributes the form to the Project Manager.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The RFC summarizes the change:

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Description

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Reasons

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Benefits

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Costs

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Impacts

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Any supporting documentation

</div>

<div class="Bullet2">

Approvals

</div>

### Review Change Request

The Project Manager reviews the RFC and determines whether or not additional information is required for the Change Advisory Board to assess the full impact of the change to the project time, scope and cost.

The decision will be based on factors, such as:

<div class="Bullet1">

Number of change options presented.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Feasibility and benefits of the change.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Complexity and/or difficulty of the change options requested.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Scale of the change solutions proposed.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The Project Manager will record the RFC details in the Change Log to track the status of the change request.

</div>

### Approve Change Request

The Project Manager will forward the Change Request Form and any supporting documentation to the Change Advisory Board or Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) for review and final approval.

They will determine the feasibility of this change by examining factors, such as:

<div class="Bullet1">

Risk to the project in implementing the change.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Risk to the project in NOT implementing the change.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Impact on the project in implementing the change (time, resources, finance, quality).

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

After a formal review, they may:

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Reject the change.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Request more information related to the change.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Approve the change as requested.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Approve the change subject to specified conditions.

</div>

### Implement and Close Change Request

If the change is approved, the following will occur:

<div class="Bullet1">

An implementation date of the change will be identified.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

A test of the change will be scheduled and performed.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The change will be implemented.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The implementation of the change will be reviewed and deemed successful or corrective actions taken.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The success of the change implementation will be communicated to all parties.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

The change request will be closed on the Change Log.

</div>

## Change Management Roles

The following will play a role in the request, review, tracking and approval of a change request:

**Change Requester**. The Change Requester initially recognizes a need for change to the project and formally communicates this requirement to the Project Manager. The Change Requester is responsible for:

<div class="Bullet1">

Identifying the requirement to make a change to the project.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Documenting the requirement by completing a RFC.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Submitting the RFC to the Project Manager for review.

</div>

**Project Manager**. The Project Manager receives, logs, monitors and controls the progress of all changes within a project. The Project Manager is responsible for:

<div class="Bullet1">

Receiving all RFCs and logging them in the Change Log.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Categorizing and prioritizing all RFCs.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Reviewing all RFCs to determine whether additional information is required.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Forwarding the RFC to the Change Control Board for approval.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Escalating all RFC issues and risks to the Change Control Board.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Reporting and communicating all decisions made by the Change Control Board.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Close the Change Request and update the Change Log when completed.

</div>

**Change Control Board**. The Change Advisory Board (CAB) is the Steering Committee or other authorized body who is the principle authority for all RFCs forwarded by the Project Manager. The Change Advisory Board Group is responsible for:

<div class="Bullet1">

Reviewing all RFCs forwarded by the Project Manager.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Considering all supporting documentation.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Approving / rejecting each RFC based on its relevant merits.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Resolving change conflict (where 2 or more changes overlap).

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Identifying the implementation timetable (for approved changes).

</div>

**Project Team/Project Manager**. The Project Team and Project Manager schedules and implements all changes.

This group is responsible for:

<div class="Bullet1">

Scheduling all changes (within the parameters provided by the Change Advisory Board).

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Testing all changes before implementation.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Implementing all changes within the project.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Reviewing the success of a change, following implementation

</div>

## Change Management Documents

The following documentation is used to monitor and/or control changes to the project.

<div class="Bullet1">

**Change Request Form**. The ‘Change Request Form’ is used to identify and describe a proposed change to the project.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

**Change Log**. This log is where all requests for changes are registered and tracked through to resolution.
