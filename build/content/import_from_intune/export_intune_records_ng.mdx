# Exporting Intune Records

Exports data for the selected imported Intune record as an Excel spreadsheet and sends an email notification when the spreadsheet is ready for download.

  - **Unique ID** – The Virima import record ID (e.g., Intune000578).
  - **Credential** – The credential set used (e.g., Intune, Intune\_Credential).
  - **Imported By** – The legged-in user who initiated the import (e.g., Admin Virima).
  - **Name** – The Intune service or resource type imported (e.g., Intune).
  - **Imported On** – The timestamp when that record was imported (as displayed in the UI).
