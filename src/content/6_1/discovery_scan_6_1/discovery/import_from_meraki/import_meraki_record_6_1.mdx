- User will be redirected to the import From Meraki page,

  - The import record will first appear with the status “<span class="Strong">Importing</span>” (the process is running and in progress).

  - The status will then change to “<span class="Strong">Adding Data</span>” (the imported information from Meraki is being processed and added to your system).

  - Once the process is finished, the status will update to “<span class="Strong">Completed</span>”.

  - After the status is “<span class="Strong">Completed</span>”, click on the imported record to view the imported Meraki resources.

  - To view the details of a CI, click on the CI. This redirects you to the discovered item page, where you can view the imported CI details.

If you do not have the necessary permissions to import—such as lacking access to authenticate with a certificate or Secret Key —the system will display an error message:  
<span class="Strong">"Please check your Meraki credentials."</span>
