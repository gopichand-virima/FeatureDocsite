# About Knowledge Management

Use this function to create and maintain a knowledge base that provides information about services, solutions, and best practices.

The primary purpose of knowledge management is to improve efficiency by reducing the need to rediscover knowledge. It enables quick access to knowledge for informed decision-making.

Knowledge management ensures that:

- The right information is delivered to the appropriate place or person at the right time
- Knowledge is reused and not recreated
- Knowledge is validated and current
- Knowledge is accessible to all staff
