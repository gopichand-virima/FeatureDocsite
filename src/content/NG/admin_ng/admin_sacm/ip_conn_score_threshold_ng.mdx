# IP Connection Score Threshold

The **IP Connection Score Threshold** feature helps administrators automatically manage and clean up outdated “Communicates With” relationships between assets. By setting a time-based threshold—defined in days, months, or years—the system ensures that only active and relevant communication links are retained, while stale connections are automatically removed during scans or cleanup processes.

In the main window, click **Admin > SACM > IP Connection Score Threshold**. The IP Connection Score Threshold displays.

Enter the numeric value for the threshold.

When all entries are made, click **Save**.
