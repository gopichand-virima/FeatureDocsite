# Process Available Patch Report

The <span class="Strong">Process Available Patch Report</span> action generates a report of all available software patches (for Windows only) applicable to the selected Configuration Items (CIs). This helps identify missing updates, security patches, and system improvements for effective patch management.

4.  Choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Process Available Patch Report</span> from the dropdown.
