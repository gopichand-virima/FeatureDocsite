# Risk Assessments

Risk Assessment provides a flexible way to capture information from the Assignee in order to derive the risk of the associated change. Libraries of questions can be used to derive the risk of a change based on criteria contained within the change. For example, a different set of questions could be set for a hardware change versus a software change.

The assessment uses a weighted score approach for each question. The overall score for an assessment is evaluated against thresholds to determine the risk of a change.

In the main window, click **Admin > Change Management > Risk Assessments**. The Risk Assessments window displays.
