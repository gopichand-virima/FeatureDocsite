# **Authorized Tab**

- Shows CI(s) that match existing entries in the CMDB - Correlator Match.
- Fields in this view:
  - **Blueprint Name**: Name of the Blueprint.
  - **CI**: CMDB CI ID matching the imported CI.
  - **Asset Name**: Provided Asset name.
  - **Asset ID**: New Asset ID is created with prefix of "IMP" to denote that this record was imported. The format is "IMP" + 6 digits (auto generated sequential number.
  - **Status**: Indicates the current status of the imported asset.
  - **What it is:** CI lifecycle state (e.g., In Use, Retired, Decommissioned).
  - **Where it comes from:** The Status dropdown is **driven by** **Admin → SACM → CMDB Properties → Status**. The same picklist is used by **Business Rules**.
  - **Host Name**: The hostname of the asset or device.
  - **Terminal ID**: Optional, stored exactly as provided; not used for correlation unless your blueprint explicitly defines it.
  - **Operating System**: The operating system detected or specified for the asset.
  - **Missing Components**: Lists any components that are missing from the imported asset.
  - **Missing Components:** Not applicable for **Imported Items**. We don't import component lists, so this field is **left blank** (or treated as **N/A**) on import. It will only be evaluated **after** a CI is **moved to CMDB** and the **Process-Missing-Components** job runs.

- Click any CI to view details of the imported assets other than the hyperlinked column under CI column.
