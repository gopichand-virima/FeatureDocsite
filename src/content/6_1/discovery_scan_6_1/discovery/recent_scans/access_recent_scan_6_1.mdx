# Column Details

1.  <span class="Strong">Scan ID</span>: The unique identifier for a scan.

2.  <span class="Strong">Scan name</span>: A unique identifier for each scan, often descriptive based on location, scan type, or schedule.

3.  <span class="Strong">Status</span>: Indicates the outcome of each scan. Possible values include:

    - <span class="Strong">Discovery agent completed the scan (successful)</span>: The master scan is marked <span class="Strong">Completed</span> only after every child scan finishes and no hosts or sub lists remain pending.

    - <span class="Strong">Scan aborted</span>: The user manually stopped the scan.

    - <span class="Strong">Scan in Progress</span>: The scan is in progress.

      - The master scan is marked <span class="Strong">In Progress</span>, if the child scan has not completed or has not been assigned a status (Success, Partial, or Failed).

3.  <span class="Strong">Triggered at</span>: Indicates when the scan started.

4.  <span class="Strong">Completed time</span>: The timestamp when the scan finished or failed. This helps track duration and performance.

5.  <span class="Strong">Duration</span>: The total time taken for the scan to complete. This helps identify unusually short (failed) or long (delayed) scans.

6.  <span class="Strong">Run by</span>: Shows which user or system triggered the scan.

7.  <span class="Strong">Rescan/Stop Scan</span>: Allows users to manually reinitiate or repeat a scan for a specific entry. Each row corresponds to a discovery scan, providing a shortcut to run that scan again, regardless of previous success. This column also allows users to abort an ongoing scan and initiate a rescan.

    - Rescans appear as the top entry in the recent scans table with the same Name.
