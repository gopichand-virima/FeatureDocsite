# Software License Validity Check

Use this function to configure notifications sent to the assigned user before the software expiration date and the software's and assets' availability in the monitored network environment.

In the main window, select **Admin > SACM > Software License Validity Check**. The Software Notifications dialog box displays.

In the *Number of days before expiry* field, enter the number of days to receive notification before the software expiration date. For example, if ”1” is entered, a notification is sent to the assigned user/user group one day before the software expiry date.

In the *Number of availability becomes* field, enter the amount of software that remains in stock. For example, if ”2” is entered, a notification is sent to the assigned user/user group when the software count indicates there are only two of the items in the stock.

In the *Send Notification* field, click the **plus + sign**. The Send Report To dialog box displays.

Click a tab to specify what *Users*, *Roles*, *Groups*, or *Departments* or *From Record* should receive a notification. You can add as many of each as required. For example, you can specify a User and a Department.
