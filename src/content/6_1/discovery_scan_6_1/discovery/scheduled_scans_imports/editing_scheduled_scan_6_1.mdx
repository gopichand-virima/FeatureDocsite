2.  Modify the details

- <span class="Strong">Name</span>/* – any clear job name.

- <span class="Strong">Probe</span>/* – choose the discovery probe (e.g., <span class="Emphasis">Deep Host Scan (WMIC /| SSH /| SNMP)</span>).

- <span class="Strong">Client</span>/* – choose the Discovery client (tenant/site) this scan will be initiated and managed from

- <span class="Strong">IP Range</span>/* – enter a target set (single IP, comma-separated IPs, ranges, or CIDR).  
  <span class="Emphasis">Tip:</span> Max is <span class="Strong">1024 IPs per scan</span>; the help text under the field shows valid formats.

- <span class="Strong">Exclude IP Range</span> (optional) – any IPs/CIDRs to skip.

- <span class="Strong">Location → Add</span> (if you tag scans by location).

- <span class="Strong">Send Scan Report To → Add</span> (choose users to receive the email report).

- <span class="Strong">Timezone</span> – pick the correct time zone for the schedule.

- <span class="Strong">Scan Frequency</span> – keep <span class="Strong">Current Time Settings</span> to use the wheels.

- <span class="Strong">Active</span> – <span class="Strong">check</span> this to make the job run.

- <span class="Strong">Recurring</span> – check if this should repeat yearly

- Use the wheels to set <span class="Strong">Second / Minute / Hour / Day / Month / Weekday</span>.

  - Pick a <span class="Strong">future</span> time (saving a past time is blocked).

  - For recurring jobs, select all values you need (e.g., multiple weekdays).

3.  Click <span class="Strong">Save</span>. Verify <span class="Strong">Next Trigger</span> updates as expected.
