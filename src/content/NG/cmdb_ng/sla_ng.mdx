# SLA

To set up response and resolution times for any CI (Incident, Request, Change, or Problem) whose Root-Cause blueprint's SLA should apply, follow these steps:

1. Open the **SLA** tab:

  - Click the desired Blueprint.
  - In the **Details** pane, switch to the **SLA** tab.

1. Set response and resolution targets:

  - **Response Time**: Enter the maximum time before the first response.
  - **Resolution Time**: Enter the total time allowed for full resolution. Note: This value must be at least the sum of your response time and any support-level response windows.

2. Define support-level response windows:

  - In the **Support Level** fields, specify the response time for each tier (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

3. Configure escalation rules:

  1.  **First column**: Choose whether the escalation fires **before** or **after** the specified delay.

  2.  **Second column**: Enter the delay amount (hours/minutes) before notifications are sent.

  3.  **Third column**: Click **Add** (for a new recipient list) or **Update** (to edit an existing one), then select users, roles, groups, or departments to alert.

For each rule, specify when it triggers, how long to wait, and who gets notified:

**When**

**Delay**

**Notification Recipients**

Before/After X

Time duration (e.g. 30 minutes)

Users, roles, groups or departments (select one or many; use the Add/Update buttons to choose or modify recipients)

1. Once all fields and escalation rules are set, click **Save** to apply.
