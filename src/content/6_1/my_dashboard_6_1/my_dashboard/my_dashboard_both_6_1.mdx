|     | There are several types of dashboards throughout the application.  For example, under ITSM, each management function has its own dashboard, as does ITAM Configuration Management. *Refer to those individual sections for details.* |

In the navigation pane, select **My Dashboard**. The My Dashboard window displays.

## User Data

The upper portion of the windows contains user-related data such as [CIs](../ITSM/Config%20Mngmt/About-Conf-Mngt.htm), [requests](../ITSM/Request-Fulfillment/Requests.htm), [problems](../ITSM/Problem-Mngmt/Problems.htm), [incidents](../ITSM/Incident-Mngmt/Incidents.htm), [changes](../ITSM/Change-Mngmnt/Changes.htm), [knowledge items](../ITSM/Knowledge-Mngmt/About-Knowledge-Mngmnt.htm), and [known errors](../ITSM/Problem-Mngmt/Known-Errors.htm).

|     | The list at the top of the window cannot be changed or removed as this information displays other data collected throughout the application. However, the details for a line item can be viewed by clicking on the item. |
