<!-- -->

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span>: Remove selected import record

  - Selected import record(s) will be deleted.

  - CI(s) imported during the selected import will be removed from Discovered Items.

  - CI(s) moved to CMDB will still appear under CMDB after deleting the Intune import record.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Export</span> – Download grid contents (selected or filtered rows) to Excel.

  - If you have selected rows, only the selected rows are exported.

  - If you have applied filters, all rows that match the current filters are exported.

  - If no filters are applied and no rows are selected, exporting will include all records from all pages.

  - The file includes the grid columns (e.g., <span class="Strong">Unique ID</span>, <span class="Strong">Name</span>, <span class="Strong">Imported By</span>, <span class="Strong">Imported On </span>and <span class="Strong">Credential</span>) (Refer Export Excel Column Detail)

This downloads the import records NOT the CI(s).

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Import</span> – Initiate a new Import from Intune.
