# Discovered item view overview

<span class="Strong">Primary Details (left panel)</span>  
Quick facts about the CI:

- <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span> – Virima’s unique identifier for the discovered CI (e.g., DSC69303). Use this to search or reference the record.

- <span class="Strong">Blueprint</span> – The discovery blueprint that matched the resource (e.g., <span class="Emphasis">Meraki Virtual Network</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Meraki Neo4j</span>). It indicates the CI’s class/type.

- <span class="Strong">Created On</span> – Timestamp when the CI was first created in the CMDB from discovery.

- <span class="Strong">Last Modified On</span> – The most recent time the CI’s data was updated (any field change or enrichment).

- <span class="Strong">Last Seen On</span> – The last successful discovery of assets. If this gets old, the asset may be offline or unreachable.

  - The "Last Seen On" field is not available for assets imported from Cloud sources.

- <span class="Strong">IP Address</span> – Last known IP detected for the CI (blank for types that don’t expose an IP).

- <span class="Strong">Host Name</span> – Host/endpoint name captured by discovery (for cloud services, often the workload/task name).

- <span class="Strong">Authorization status</span> – A badge indicating <span class="Strong">Authorized</span> or <span class="Strong">This CI is unauthorized</span>:

  - <span class="Emphasis">Authorized</span> = the CI is recognized/approved to exist in the CMDB; surfaced from Authorize tab of Import from Meraki import records view.

    - An authorized asset always has an associated CMDB ID, such as "<span class="Strong">Update to /<CMDB Asset ID/></span>".

  - <span class="Emphasis">Unauthorized</span> = the CI is new or not yet approved; typically surfaced from the <span class="Emphasis">Unauthorized</span> tab in import views.

- <span class="Strong">Tags</span> – If any  
  Tags are Meraki metadata key-value pairs attached to resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.).
