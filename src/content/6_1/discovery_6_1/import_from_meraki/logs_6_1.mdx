# Logs

Open the **Logs** tab to review the run output (start/end times, counts, and messages for each stage).

The Logs tab provides detailed information about each import operation, including:
- Start and completion timestamps
- Number of devices discovered
- Success and error messages
- API call details
- Processing status for each device type

This information is useful for troubleshooting import issues and verifying successful imports.
