# Discovery Monitoring Profile

Use this function to monitor machines based on certain defined properties, which are set as Trigger Conditions at a given frequency. If a condition matches, it creates an ITSM record with pre-defined values based on Action Details.

- AND the [Action Details](/admin_discovery/mon_prof_action_details_6_1.mdx) *Target Module* is **Incident**, then an incident will be created in the application...
- THEN **[Notifications](/admin_discovery/mon_prof_notifications_6_1.mdx)** will be sent to the configured users, roles, groups, or departments.
