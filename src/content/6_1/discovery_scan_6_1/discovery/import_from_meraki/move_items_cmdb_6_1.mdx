# Move items to the CMDB

After importing Meraki data, promote it to the CMDB.

2.  Click <span class="Strong">Move to CMDB</span>.

<!-- -->

3.  In the confirmation dialog, click <span class="Strong">Continue</span>.  
    The move job runs <span class="Strong">in the background</span>—no further action is required. Use <span class="Strong">Auto Refresh</span> to watch status changes.

Tip: If no rows are selected, your environment will move <span class="Strong">all records that match the current filters</span>. If you want to limit scope, always select the exact rows to move.

4.  Upon successful move to CMDB, the records will be deleted from “Import from Meraki” and “Discovered Items” View.
