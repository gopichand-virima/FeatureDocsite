# Importing Meraki Record

Use this function to import the required Meraki resources into the Discovery application.

- Open the Import From Meraki page, From the **Select Actions** drop-down list, choose **Import**.

- The Import From Meraki dialog box displays.

- In the Name field, enter a name for the import action.
- In the Credential field, click the drop-down list and select the appropriate credential to access the Meraki service.
  - If no credentials are listed in the dropdown, add credentials by navigating to **Admin > Discovery > Credentials**.
- Click **Add** to import the Meraki services to virima.

The system displays an error if Add is clicked without selecting credentials.

- User will be redirected to the import From Meraki page,
  - The import record will first appear with the status “**Importing**” (the process is running and in progress).
  - The status will then change to “**Adding Data**” (the imported information from Meraki is being processed and added to your system).
  - Once the process is finished, the status will update to “**Completed**”.
  - After the status is “**Completed**”, click on the imported record to view the imported Meraki resources.
  - To view the details of a CI, click on the CI. This redirects you to the discovered item page, where you can view the imported CI details.

If you do not have the necessary permissions to import—such as lacking access to authenticate with a certificate or Secret Key —the system will display an error message:  
**"Please check your Meraki credentials."**
