# Remote Install

Use this function to install an agent remotely on a client. To determine if an agent already exists on a client, check the agents tab of the Host Name or IP Address of the host are present.

Ensure the client *State* is set to "true." Otherwise, the remote Discovery Agent cannot be installed. Also, the installation of an agent removes the old agent and installs the new agent on the host.

In the main window, click **Admin > Discovery > Client**.

Select the applicable client. A new window opens with the **Details** tab displayed.

Click the **Discovery Agents** tab.

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Remote Install**. The Remote Discovery Agent Install dialog box displays.

By default, the *Application IP* address displays. This information cannot be edited.

In the *Scan through* field, select the radio button for either **IP Address** or **Host Name**.

- If **IP Address** is selected, in the *Agent IP* field, type the **IP address** onto which the agent is installed.
- If **Host Name** is selected, in the *Host Names* field, type the **Host Name**.

If the *IP Address* or *Host Name* already exists, click the check box for **Re-Install if exist.**

Click **Install and Schedule** to specify the time the installation should occur. The *Bulk Schedule Scan dialog box* displays (see below). A folder in the following path will be created on the machine: *C:\Program Files\Virima Discovery Application\tools\agent*

Click **Install** to begin the installation.

## Bulk Schedule Scan Dialog Box

From the **Scan Frequency** drop-down list, select the required frequency for the scan.

To repeat the scan at the frequency selected, select **Is Recurring**.

Select the **Time** (Second, Minute, Hour) and **Date** (Day, Month, Weekday) for the scan to occur.

ClickRun.

Click **Update**.
