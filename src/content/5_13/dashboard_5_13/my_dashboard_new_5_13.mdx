# My Dashboard

Use this function to view user-related data and selected reports.


There are several types of dashboards throughout the application. For example, under ITSM, each management function has its own dashboard, as does ITAM Configuration Management. *Refer to those individual sections for details.*


From the navigation pane, select **My Dashboard**. The My Dashboard window displays.

## User Data

The upper portion of the windows contains user-related data such CIs, requests, problems, incidents, changes, knowledge items and known errors.


The list at the top of the window cannot be changed or removed as this information displays other data collected throughout the application. However, the details for a line item can be viewed by clicking on the item.


Click **Show All** to display all items for the selected category (such as CIs, Requests, and so forth).

## Reports

The lower area of the window shows all reports that have been added. To manage dashboard contents, click [Add Contents](/my_dashboard/dashboard_add_contents_new_5_13.mdx).

Examples are shown below:


- [Auto Refresh](/common_topics/auto_refresh_5_13.mdx)
- [Items Per Page](/common_topics/items_per_page_5_13.mdx)
