# Troubleshooting Scheduled Jobs

# **Job Not Running**

- **Check Active Status:** Ensure the job is marked as **Active**.
- **Verify Timezone:** Confirm the timezone setting matches your expectations.
- **Check System Services:** Ensure the Virima scheduler service is running.

# **Scan or Import Fails**

- **Review Logs:** Open the **Logs** tab in the scheduled job details to identify errors.
- **Credential Issues:** Verify that credentials used by the job are valid and have not expired.
- **Network Connectivity:** Ensure the discovery client or cloud endpoint is reachable from the Virima server.

# **No Data Imported**

- **Check Filters:** Ensure the configured IP range (for scans) or selected services (for imports) are correct.
- **Verify Permissions:** Confirm that the credential has sufficient permissions to access the target resources.

# **Job Runs but No Results Appear**

- Check the **Recent Scans** or **Import** pages for corresponding execution records.
- Ensure filters are not hiding the results.
