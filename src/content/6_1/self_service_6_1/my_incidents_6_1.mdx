Use this function to display the status of Incidents that are created by the logged in user.


- Role access for incidents is required.
- An incident can be canceled, but this must be done before the incident is closed.


In the navigation pane, select **Self Service > My Incidents**. The resulting window displays a list of all incidents.

To view the related incident information, under Incident ID, click the **hyperlink**. The related [Incident](/itsm/incident_mngmt/incidents_ng.mdx) window displays.
