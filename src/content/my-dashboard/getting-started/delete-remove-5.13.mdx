# Delete/Remove

Safely delete or remove records and items from the Virima system.

## Overview

The Delete/Remove function allows authorized users to remove records, items, or data from the Virima platform. This function includes safeguards to prevent accidental deletion and maintains audit trails for compliance.

## Delete vs. Remove

### Delete
- Permanently removes a record from the system
- Cannot be undone (unless backup exists)
- Removes all associated data and relationships
- Requires specific permissions

### Remove
- Removes item from a list or collection
- Does not delete the underlying record
- Can be re-added later
- Less restrictive permissions required

## Deleting Records

### Single Record Deletion
1. Navigate to the record you want to delete
2. Click the **Delete** button or icon
3. Review the deletion confirmation message
4. Confirm the deletion
5. Record is permanently removed

### Bulk Deletion
1. Select multiple records using checkboxes
2. Click **Bulk Actions** or similar menu
3. Choose **Delete Selected**
4. Review the list of records to be deleted
5. Confirm bulk deletion

## Permissions
