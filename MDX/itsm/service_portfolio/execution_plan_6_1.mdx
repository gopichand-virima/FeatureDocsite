# Execution Plan

An execution plan describes how a catalog item is procured, configured, and installed. Each execution plan contains one or more tasks. For example, an organization might create an execution plan for delivering a corporate standard Laptop that contains these tasks:

- Procure the Laptop from a supplier.
- Configure the Laptop according to the requester's specifications.
- Deliver the Laptop to the requester.

An execution plan is not specific to any one catalog item. There could be many different models of Laptop that a user can order, all using the same execution plan. It is usually not necessary to create a new execution plan for each individual catalog item in a mature service catalog.

## Execution Plan Tasks

An execution plan contains one or more execution plan tasks. Each task represents work that needs to be completed by a specific group as part of the overall request fulfillment process. Administrators create templates for tasks as part of defining an execution plan. The catalog tasks themselves are then created when the relevant item is requested based on these task templates.

## Using Execution Plans

Once you have created the execution plan record, you can associate it with catalog items.

## Create an Execution Plan

Administrators and Service Catalog Owners can create and manage execution plans.


Developing an execution plan involves these general steps:

- Create the execution plan record.
- Create the tasks that make up the execution plan.
- Associate the execution plan with one or more catalog items.

In the navigation pane, select **ITSM > Service Portfolio > Service Catalog > Execution Plan**. The Execution Plan window displays containing a list of all configured execution plans.
