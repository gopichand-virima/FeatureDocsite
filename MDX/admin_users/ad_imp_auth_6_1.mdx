# AD Configuration

Use this function to create a new Active Directory configuration.

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks and is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services.

## What is Active Directory

An AD domain controller authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Active Directory makes use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.

In the main window, click **Admin > Users > AD Configuration**. The AD Configuration window displays.

### New AD Configuration

- From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **AD New Configuration**.
- The **New** dialog box displays.

!

- On the **Configuration** tab, fill in the values for the attributes.


By default, the Login Attribute is set to *userPrincipalName*. When **Is Public** is selected, there is no *Client* field.


- Click **Next**. The Map Properties tab displays.
- Select (check) the fields that need to be imported, and map their values to that of an applicable AD property.
- Click **Save**.


### Testing AD Configuration

- Open the **AD Configuration** line item**.**
- From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Test AD Configuration**.
- If successful: The system confirms the AD configuration is valid.
- If unsuccessful: An Alert Message will appear. For example:

“This discovery client is down. Please bring it up or select another discovery client.”

This means the configured discovery client is either not running or unavailable, and must be restarted or replaced.

If you have set the values of the attributes correctly as per your organization's AD structure, then the connection will be a success. Otherwise, it will fail.


### Import Users

While Importing users into Virima , Virima looks whether a particular Location, Role, Designation, Department and Group is present, if not Virima creates one.

For consecutive AD imports, the value of a user gets updated if the value has been modified in the AD.
