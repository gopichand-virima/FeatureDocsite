# Pre-requisites

Before configuring and running a scheduled scan in Virima, ensure you meet these requirements:

1. **Probe Availability**: Confirm that you uploaded the necessary discovery probes. Virima provides default probes. For specialized probes, contact Virima Support.

2. **Client Setup**: Install, configure, and activate the Discovery Application.

3. **Credential Configuration**: Add and validate all required credentials for target systems.

4. **Target Identification**: Define the IP addresses or hostnames to scan.

5. **Location Record (Optional)**: If you intend to associate scans with a specific location, create the relevant location record.

6. **Report Recipients (Optional)**: Only valid and active Virima users can be report recipients. Ensure all intended recipients appear in the user directory with correct email addresses and roles. Only these users will be available for selection when configuring scan notifications.

7. **Cloud Import Credentials (Meraki/Azure/AWS)**: For cloud imports, configure the appropriate API credentials and complete mapping accurately.
