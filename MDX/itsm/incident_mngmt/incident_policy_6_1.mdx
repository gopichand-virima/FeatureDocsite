# Incident Policy

The Incident process should be followed for all incidents covered by an existing service agreement, regardless of whether the request is eventually managed as a project or through the Incident process.

- Support for enhancement of existing services identified in existing Service Agreements requires an Incident case to be opened.
- Incidents should be prioritized based upon impact to the customer and the availability of a workaround.
- “Incident Ownership remains with the Service Desk! Regardless of where an incident is referred to during its life, ownership of the incident remains with the Service Desk at all times. The Service Desk remains responsible for tracking progress, keeping users informed and ultimately for Incident Closure.” – ITIL Service Operation
- Rules for re-opening incidents - Despite all adequate care, there will be occasions when incidents recur even though they have been formally closed. If the incident recurs within one working day then it can be re-opened – but that beyond this point a new incident must be raised, but linked to the previous incident(s).
- Any work around should be in conformance with clients standards and policies.
