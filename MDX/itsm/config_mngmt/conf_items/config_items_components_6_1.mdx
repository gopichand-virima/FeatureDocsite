# CI: Components

Any changes need to be made in Discovered Items Components as well.

Every configuration item has software and hardware associated with it. These components vary based on the [blueprint](/admin_sacm/blueprints_6_1.mdx).

When a new CI component is added, an email notification is sent to those Roles configured as per the SACM RACI matrix and email preferences.  

To access the functions, do the following:

- From the navigation pane, select **ITSM > Configuration Management > Configuration Items**. The Configuration Items window displays.
- From the navigation pane, select **Configuration Management > Configuration Items**. The Configuration Items window displays.
- Select a record in the list. A new window opens and the **Details** tab displays.
- Click the **[Components](/itsm/config_mngmt/components/ci_comp_list_6_1.mdx)** tab. The applicable tabs and subtabs for the selected asset display.


Some tabs can be edited while others are view only. In addition, some tabs have sub-components.
