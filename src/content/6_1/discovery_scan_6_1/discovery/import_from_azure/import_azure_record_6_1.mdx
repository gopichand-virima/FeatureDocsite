- Click <span class="Strong">Add</span> to import the AZURE services to virima.

  - User will be redirected to the import From AZURE page, where the new import record will be shown with the Status as “<span class="Strong">Importing</span>”.

  - Once the status is “<span class="Strong">Completed</span>", Click on the imported record to view the imported AZURE resources.

  - To view the details of the CI, click on the CI. This redirects you to the discovered item page, where you can view the imported CI details.

If you do not have the necessary permissions to import—such as lacking access to authenticate with a certificate or Secret Key —the system will display an error message:  
<span class="Strong">"Please check your Azure credentials."</span>
