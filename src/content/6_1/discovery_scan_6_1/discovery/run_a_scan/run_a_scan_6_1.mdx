# Overview

The <span class="Strong">Run a Scan</span> feature in Virima allows IT administrators to initiate and configure scans to discover assets, audit systems, and gather critical IT data. Users can define scan parameters such as IP ranges, probe types, scheduling, and report recipients. Multiple scan types are supported (e.g., host, certificate, port, AD, SQL, Kubernetes, website), each tailored for specific discovery or audit needs. Scans can be run immediately or scheduled, and results are sent to selected users or groups. The process requires proper prerequisites (credentials, client setup) and supports flexible configuration for targeted, efficient IT discovery and monitoring.
