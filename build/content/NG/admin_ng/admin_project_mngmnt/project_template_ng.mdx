Phases

A project template always starts with a phase and then has associated tasks. A project can be associated with multiple phases and, in turn, a phase can have multiple tasks.

In the Project Template window, select an existing template.

Click the **Phases** tab.

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Add Phase**. The Phase Information dialog box displays.

Complete the fields, referring to the table below.

When all selections/entries are made, click Add.

### Phase Information Fields

| Field | Description |

| Type | Specifies the phase name. |

| Duration | Indicates the number of days by which the phase or task must be completed. Duration is based on the organization working days. |

| Name | The name for the task. |

| Planned Start | For the first phase, the date will be set to value of the Project’s Planned Start. Subsequent Phases Planned Start will be computed based on the previous phase’s duration. In other words this date will be same as the previous phase’s Planned End date. |

| Planned End | Computed based on the latest due date of that phase or task deliverable/milestone. |

| Actual Start | This filed is set automatically when the State of a Phase is set to Started and also when the Project is set to Active.

The State for the First phase is set to Started the moment the any of the deliverable/milestone task is completed. Once a date is set, there can be no further modifications made. |

| Actual End | This date is computed and set, when that phase’s task state is set to ‘Completed.’ Once this date is set, it cannot be changed. |

| Status | There are four statuses:

- **Not started**. Initial stage of a phase/task.
- **Started**. It indicates that a phase/task is started and sets the actual start date of a phase/task.
- **Active**. This status set the actual start date of a phase/task as well. The first phase of the project will be set to Active automatically, when the project status is changed to Active.
- **Completed**. Indicates that the task is completed and it sets the actual end date.

This field cannot be edited for a Project Template.

A Phase is marked as *Completed* when *Go under Review* is selected.

Once a phase/task is completed, attributes are no longer editable. |

| Gate Type | This is available only for Phase. There are two types of Gates:

**Hard Gate**. If a phase has a hard gate its successor phase cannot be started/made active without completing its top level phase. Hard Gate phases are shown in red.
**Soft Gate**. If a phase has a soft gate its successor phase can be made active/started irrespective of its top level phase |

| Review | This is available only for Phase.

- **Go.** This option will be available only when all the mandatory tasks of a phase are completed. Selecting this option marks the current phase as Completed and the succeeding phase status will be changed to Active automatically.
- **Suspended**. A phase can be suspended at any status and that would in turn suspend the project. |

| Percentage Complete | The percentage of completion for this phase. |

| Notes | Additional information about this phase. |


Gate type can be changed only during the Not Started State.
