# Accessing the Import From Intune window

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan › Import From Intune.**

!

1. The **Import From Intune** window opens and displays list of imported records. Each row represents a single import run.

  !

- **Key columns:**
  - **Id**: Unique identification ID of the import run (e.g., Intune005553), records imported from Intune will have the prefix “Intune” followed by a six-digit sequential number.
  - ****Name**:** The user provided name used to identify the import run.
  - **Imported On**: The date and time when the import was completed.
  - **Imported By**: The logged-in user who initiated an import.
  - **Credential**: Virima credential profile used to connect to Intune.
  - **Select Actions**: Perform bulk operations on selected or filtered rows.
- From the **Select Actions** drop-down list, choose the operation you want to perform.

  !


- **Delete**: Remove selected import record
  - Selected import record(s) will be deleted.
  - CI(s) imported during the selected import will be removed from Discovered Items.
  - CI(s) moved to CMDB will still appear under CMDB after deleting the Intune import record.
- **Export** – Download grid contents (selected or filtered rows) to Excel.
  - If you have selected rows, only the selected rows are exported.
  - If you have applied filters, all rows that match the current filters are exported.
  - If no filters are applied and no rows are selected, exporting will include all records from all pages.
  - The file includes the grid columns (e.g., **Unique ID**, **Name**, **Imported By**, **Imported On **and **Credential**) (Refer Export Excel Column Detail)

This downloads the import records NOT the CI(s).

- **Import** – Initiate a new Import from Intune.
