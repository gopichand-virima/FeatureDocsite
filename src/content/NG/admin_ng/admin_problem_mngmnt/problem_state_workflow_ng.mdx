# Problem State Workflow

Use this function to create automated workflows that define how problems progress through their lifecycle stages.

By associating a problem workflow with a problem record, the process is quicker and eliminates the need for manual stage/state changes by users with relevant access. Once a problem workflow is associated with a problem, the stage/state transitions happen automatically based on defined conditions, and relevant roles are notified.

In the main window, click **Admin > Problem Management > Problem State Workflow**. The Problem State Workflow window displays.
