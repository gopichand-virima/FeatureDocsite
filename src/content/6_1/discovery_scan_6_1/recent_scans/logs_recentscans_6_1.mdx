# Logs Tab

The Logs tab provides a real-time, detailed trace of the scan\'s progress and actions taken by the discovery engine on the targeted host(s). It\'s especially helpful for troubleshooting, validation, and understanding scan behavior.

Details include:

- **Host type discovery**\
 Lines like:

 - 192.168.40.83 is of type Windows → OS fingerprinting succeeded.

 - ... is of type UnknownHost → the probe couldn't fingerprint the OS (often due to closed ports or blocked protocols).

- **Sensor invocation**\
 Examples (you'll see many of these):

 - Going to invoke sensor Windows WMIC System Info ...

 - ... Windows Installed Software ...

 - ... Certificate Check ...\
 These show which **sensor** ran for that IP and phase (WMIC/WMI, SSH, SNMP, disk, process, certificate, etc.).

- **Responses / outcomes**

 - ... to process response or Scan completed indicates a successful sensor pass.

 - Timeouts, auth failures, or connection errors will be printed here useful for troubleshooting credentials, firewalls, or network reachability.
