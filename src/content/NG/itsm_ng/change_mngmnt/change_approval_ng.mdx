# Change Approval Process

The change approval process ensures that all changes are properly reviewed, evaluated, and authorized before implementation.

## Approval Workflow Overview

Changes move through different approval stages based on their type, risk, and impact.

### Approval Stages

1. **Initial Review**: Change Manager reviews for completeness
2. **Technical Approval**: Technical leads assess feasibility
3. **Business Approval**: Business owners evaluate impact
4. **CAB Approval**: Change Advisory Board reviews and approves
5. **Final Authorization**: Final sign-off before implementation

## Approval Roles

### Change Manager
- Reviews all change requests
- Ensures completeness of documentation
- Assigns to appropriate approvers
- Monitors approval progress
- Escalates delayed approvals

### Technical Approvers
- Assess technical feasibility
- Review implementation plans
- Validate resource requirements
- Identify technical risks
- Approve/reject from technical perspective

### Business Approvers
- Evaluate business impact
- Assess timing and scheduling
- Review communication plans
- Approve/reject from business perspective
- Ensure alignment with business objectives

### CAB Members
- Review complex or high-risk changes
- Provide multi-disciplinary perspective
- Assess overall risk vs. benefit
- Make final approval decisions
- Set implementation priorities

## Approval Process Steps

### Step 1: Submit for Approval

1. Complete all required change fields
2. Attach supporting documentation
3. Click **Submit for Approval**
4. System sends notifications to approvers

### Step 2: Approver Notification

Approvers receive notifications containing:
- Change summary
- Risk assessment
- Impact analysis
- Implementation timeline
- Link to full change details

### Step 3: Review Change

Approvers access the change to:
- Review all documentation
- Assess risks and benefits
- Verify implementation plan
- Check resource availability
- Review affected CIs

### Step 4: Approval Decision

Approvers can take the following actions:

#### Approve
- Indicates agreement with the change
- May add approval comments
- Change proceeds to next approval stage

#### Reject
- Indicates the change should not proceed
- **Must** provide rejection reason
- Change returns to requester
- Can be resubmitted after addressing concerns

#### Request Information
- Approver needs additional details
- Change placed on hold
- Notification sent to change owner
- Approval resumes after information provided

#### Delegate
- Transfer approval to another person
- Used when primary approver unavailable
- Delegate receives approval request
- Original approver notified of delegation

### Step 5: Approval Completion

Once all approvals received:
- Change status updates automatically
- Notifications sent to relevant parties
- Change ready for scheduling
- Implementation can proceed

## Parallel vs Sequential Approvals

### Parallel Approvals
- Multiple approvers review simultaneously
- Faster approval process
- All approvers must approve
- Single rejection stops the change

**Use When:**
- Time is critical
- Approvers review independent aspects
- No dependencies between approvals

### Sequential Approvals
- Approvers review in specific order
- Later approvers see earlier decisions
- Structured approval hierarchy
- Each stage builds on previous

**Use When:**
- Approvals have dependencies
- Later approvers need context from earlier reviews
- Hierarchical approval structure required

## Approval Policies

### Automatic Approval Rules

Configure rules for automatic approval:

1. **Standard Changes**: Auto-approved if meet criteria
2. **Low-Risk Changes**: Approve based on risk score
3. **Repeat Changes**: Approve similar successful changes

#### Configuration
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Change Management** > **Approval Rules**
2. Define approval criteria
3. Set conditions for automatic approval
4. Test rules before activating

### Approval Thresholds

Set thresholds that trigger different approval levels:

- **Financial Impact**: Changes above certain cost require CFO approval
- **User Impact**: Changes affecting >X users require business approval
- **System Criticality**: Changes to critical systems require senior management
- **Risk Level**: High-risk changes require full CAB review
