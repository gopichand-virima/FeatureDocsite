## Printing

Help topics can be printed. Display the topic and click the **Printer** icon.

Some help topics contain drop-down sections. Expand the drop-down section to ensure the content is included when printing. In the example below, the arrow next to *New Cost Center* is facing up, indicating the topic content is displayed. However, the arrow next *Edit Cost Center* and *Delete Cost Center* is facing down, indicating the topic content is not shown.
