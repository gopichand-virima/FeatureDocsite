# Overview

The **Import from Meraki** feature in Virima streamlines the discovery and management of Cisco Meraki cloud-managed devices. By connecting securely to the Meraki dashboard via APIs and configured credentials, this function automates the import of devices such as Access Points, Switches, Firewalls, and Routers into Virima's asset management system.

This integration eliminates manual data entry, ensures that the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) remains accurate, and provides unified visibility across both on-premises and cloud-managed infrastructures. As a result, IT teams can achieve better operational efficiency, improve compliance, and maintain a consolidated view of their network assets.
