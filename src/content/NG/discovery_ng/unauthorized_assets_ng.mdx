# Unauthorized Assets

Use this function to view assets that were scanned, discovered or imported but are not present inside the CMDB.

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan > Discovered Items**. The Discovered Items window displays.

Click the *Filter By* drop-down and select **New**. The list updates and lists all assets that can be moved to the CMDB.

Select a record, then from the *Select Actions* drop-down list, select **Move to CMDB**.

When the Alert Message displays, click **Continue**. A message displays indicating the record is being moved, and the line item for the record being moved is grayed out. Once the record is moved, it no longer displays in the list.
