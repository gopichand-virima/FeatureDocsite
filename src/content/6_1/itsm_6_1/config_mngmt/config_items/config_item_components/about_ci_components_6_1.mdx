# CI: Components

Any changes made here need to be made in Discovered Items Components as well.

Every configuration item has software and hardware associated with it. These components vary based on the [blueprint](/admin_sacm/blueprints_6_1.mdx).

When a new CI component is added, an email notification is sent to those Roles configured as per the SACM RACI matrix and email preferences.  

To access the functions, do the following:

In the navigation pane, select **ITSM > Configuration Management > CMDB**. The Configuration Items window displays.

In the navigation pane, select **Configuration Management > CMDB**. The Configuration Items window displays.

Select a record in the list. A new window opens and the **Details** tab displays.

Click **Components**. The applicable tabs and sub-tabs for the selected asset display. *Refer to [CI: Component Tab Options](/itsm/config_mngmt/config_items/config_item_components/component_tab_options_6_1.mdx)*.


Some tabs can be edited while others are view only. In addition, some tabs have sub-components.
