# Configuration Items (CI)

Configuration Items (CI) are components or other service assets that must be managed to deliver an IT service.

In Virima:

- Each CI is derived from a Blueprint, with components that can be Network Adapters, Storage Disks, Software Instances, etc.
- Each CI component is associated with the parent CI using Relationships, for example, Installed On, Component Of, Hosted On, Virtualized On, etc.
- Each CI/CI Component in Ecosystem Manager has a unique Asset ID.

CI's are added when they are:

- Moved manually into CMDB.
- Discovered by the Discovery application as they are moved into CMDB.
- Imported from a file (.xls, .xlsx, or .csv).

In the navigation pane, select **ITSM > Configuration Management > CMDB**. The Configuration Items window displays.

In the navigation pane, select **ITAM > Configuration Management > CMDB**. The Configuration Items window displays.
