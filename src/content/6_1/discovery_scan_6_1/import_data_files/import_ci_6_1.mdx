[Expected Columns & What to Enter]{.Strong}

- [Asset Name]{.Strong}\
 The name of the asset (e.g., server host + IP).

- [IP Address]{.Strong} *(possible correlator)*\
 The host's primary IP (e.g., 10.14.80.36). If your blueprint uses IP as a correlator, this helps match to an existing CI.

- [Host Name]{.Strong} *(possible correlator)*\
 Host name of the device (e.g., ADSERVERLD). Another common correlator.

- [Mac Address]{.Strong} *(possible correlator)*\
 Physical MAC address (e.g., 00:50:56:B4:01:5). Use standard notation and only one MAC per row.

- [Blueprint Name]{.Strong} **(Mandatory)**\
 The CMDB blueprint that defines the CI's schema (e.g., **Windows Server**). Must exactly match an existing blueprint name.

- [Asset Id]{.Strong} *(Mandatory only for updates)*\
 The CMDB ID of an **existing** CI (e.g., AST003156).

- [Acquisition Date]{.Strong}\
 A datetime field for asset lifecycle. **Format must be** MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (e.g., 12/22/2022 07:00:00 AM).

[Mandatory Import Rules]{.Strong}

- [For New CIs:]{.Strong}

 - **Blueprint Name** is required.

 - At least **one correlator** (IP Address, Host Name, or Mac Address, as defined by the blueprint) must be present.

- [For Updating Existing CIs:]{.Strong}

 - **Asset Id** is required.

 - Correlators (IP, Host Name, MAC) help validate matches but are not strictly required if Asset Id is provided.

- [Date/Time Fields:]{.Strong}

 - Must follow the format MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.

4. Click [Upload]{.Strong}.

5. A preview of the data to import appears, showing how each attribute is mapped to the column headers in your sample file.

6. If the default mapping is incorrect, use the dropdown to change the attribute name.

7. Click [Submit]{.Strong} to proceed.

 - Ensure all correlator properties are mapped.

 - If a property is highlighted in **red**, it means it is not properly mapped to an application field; use **Skip Column** if you do not wish to map that property.

 - If a property is highlighted in **green**, it means it is successfully mapped to an application field.

- If a record in your Excel (or CSV) import file does not have a value for the "Blueprint Name" column, that record will not appear in the Import Data Files.

- If a record has a "**Blueprint Name**" but does not have any correlator (such as IP Address, Host Name, or MAC Address---as required by the blueprint), that record will also not be shown in the Import Data Files.

8. When prompted, a confirmation pop-up will ask if you want to save the current mapping as a template.

9. Click [Yes]{.Strong} to save the template.

10. Enter a name for your template in the pop-up and click [Save and Continue]{.Strong}.

 - You can reuse a saved field mapping template for future CI imports as long as the selected blueprint matches the blueprint associated with the template.

11. After import, a new row appears in the file list, displaying the imported file name, status, uploaded on, and uploaded by fields.

- The system shows an error message if a user tries to upload without a file.
