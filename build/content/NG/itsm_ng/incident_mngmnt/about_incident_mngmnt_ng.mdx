# About Incident Management

Use this function to configure and manage incidents. An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service.

The primary goal of incident management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and minimize the adverse impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained.

Roles with relevant access can view, add, edit, approve, reject, resolve and close an incident.
