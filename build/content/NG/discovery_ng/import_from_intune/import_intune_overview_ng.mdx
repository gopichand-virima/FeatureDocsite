# Overview

The **Import from Intune** function enables direct discovery and import of managed devices and mobile endpoints from Microsoft Intune into Virima's CMDB. This feature connects securely to Intune tenants using API credentials to retrieve an accurate, real-time inventory of mobile devices, applications, and compliance data.

By leveraging Intune's mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) capabilities, organizations can maintain visibility over their mobile fleet without requiring additional discovery infrastructure. This approach streamlines mobile asset management, ensures continuous synchronization with live Intune data, and reduces operational overhead for IT teams managing BYOD and corporate mobile devices.
