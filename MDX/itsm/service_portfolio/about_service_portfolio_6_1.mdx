# About Service Portfolio

Service Portfolio Management is the process responsible for the assembly of an initial Service Design Package (SDP) for each service and its maintenance through the service life cycle. The SDP may be altered and extended by other Service Management processes since users should be provided with a customer-specific view on this portfolio - the Service Catalog - Service Catalog Administration is an important administrative sub process related to Service Portfolio Management.

The purpose of Service Portfolio Management is to create, manage and improve a service portfolio containing a detailed design package for each IT service.

Through the Service Portfolio module, you create the Service Catalog with:

- [Catalog Items](/itsm/service_portfolio/catalog_items_6_1.mdx)
- [Category](/itsm/service_portfolio/category_6_1.mdx)
- [Order Item Link](/itsm/service_portfolio/order_item_link_6_1.mdx)
- [Execution Plan](/itsm/service_portfolio/execution_plan_6_1.mdx)
