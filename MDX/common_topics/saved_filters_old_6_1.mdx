## Creating a Filter

- Under the column heading, click in the *Filter for \[name of filter\]* field.
- Type the text to filter by and press **Enter**. The filter is added to the criteria area. The window updates, and all matching records (if any) are displayed.

!  

- Click the **Save Filter** text.
- In the Save Filter dialog box, type a name to identify this filter, and click **Save**.

You can continue to filter the results (steps 1 and 2) and save additional filter(s) (step 3) by repeating the above steps.


## Applying a Filter

Saved filters are used to sort results with previously entered search criteria. This eliminates the need to recreate a new filter each time a user wants to search the list of records.

- In the results window, move to the upper right corner and click the **Saved Filter** icon. The Filters window displays.

- Select the filter you want to apply from the list.
- To save a filter as the default, click **Set as Default**. Only one filter can be the default.
- To delete the filter, click the **trashcan** icon.
