# Change Scheduling

Effective change scheduling minimizes business disruption and ensures successful implementation of changes.

## Scheduling Overview

Change scheduling involves coordinating:
- Implementation time windows
- Resource availability
- Business impact
- Technical dependencies
- Blackout periods

## Change Calendar

### Accessing the Change Calendar

1. Navigate to **ITSM** > **Change Management**
2. Click **Change Calendar** tab
3. View scheduled changes in calendar format

### Calendar Views

#### Month View
- Overview of all scheduled changes
- Color-coded by change type
- Quick identification of busy periods

#### Week View
- Detailed daily schedule
- Time slots for each change
- Resource allocation visibility

#### Day View
- Hour-by-hour schedule
- Detailed change information
- Conflict detection

### Calendar Filters

Filter calendar display by:
- Change type
- Priority
- Assigned team
- Affected systems
- Change category

## Scheduling a Change

### Prerequisites

Before scheduling a change:
- Change must be approved
- Implementation plan completed
- Resources identified
- Backout plan documented

### Scheduling Steps

1. Open the approved change request
2. Click **Schedule** button
3. Select implementation date
4. Choose time window
5. Verify resource availability
6. Check for conflicts
7. Confirm schedule

### Scheduling Fields

#### Implementation Date
- Planned start date for change
- Must be after approval date
- Should align with maintenance windows

#### Start Time
- Specific time change will begin
- Consider time zones for global changes
- Factor in preparation time

#### End Time
- Expected completion time
- Include buffer for issues
- Account for verification activities

#### Maintenance Window
- Select from predefined windows
- Custom window option available
- Aligned with business requirements

## Maintenance Windows

### Predefined Windows

Standard maintenance windows:

**Production Systems**
- Saturday: 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM
- Sunday: 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM

**Non-Production Systems**
- Weekdays: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
- Weekends: Any time

**Critical Systems**
- Quarterly scheduled windows
- Pre-announced to organization
- Extended duration (4-8 hours)

### Custom Maintenance Windows

Create custom windows for specific needs:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Change Management**
2. Select **Maintenance Windows**
3. Click **New Window**
4. Define:
   - Window name
   - Day and time
   - Duration
   - Recurrence pattern
   - Applicable systems

## Blackout Periods

Blackout periods are times when changes are not permitted.

### Common Blackout Periods

- **Financial Year End**: 2 weeks
- **Holiday Seasons**: Major holidays ± 1 week
- **Peak Business Periods**: Based on business calendar
- **Audit Periods**: During external audits

### Configuring Blackout Periods

1. Go to **Admin** > **Change Management** > **Blackout Periods**
2. Click **New Blackout Period**
3. Specify:
   - Name and description
   - Start and end dates
   - Affected systems
   - Exception process
   - Approval authority for exceptions

### Blackout Period Exemptions

Emergency changes may be exempted:
- Requires senior management approval
- Documented business justification
- Risk assessment completed
- Extra precautions implemented

## Conflict Detection

### Automatic Conflict Checks

System automatically checks for:

#### Resource Conflicts
- Team members assigned to multiple changes
- Insufficient staff for implementation
- Key personnel unavailable

#### System Conflicts
- Multiple changes to same CI
- Dependent system changes
- Network maintenance conflicts

#### Schedule Conflicts
- Overlapping time windows
- Blackout period violations
- Maintenance window capacity

### Resolving Conflicts

When conflicts detected:

1. Review conflict details
2. Evaluate options:
   - Reschedule one or more changes
   - Adjust implementation time
   - Reassign resources
   - Coordinate simultaneous changes
3. Update schedule
4. Recheck for conflicts

## Change Coordination

### Coordinating Multiple Changes

When scheduling related changes:

#### Sequential Changes
- Change A must complete before Change B
- Set dependencies in system
- Schedule with buffer time between
- Monitor first change completion

#### Parallel Changes
- Can occur simultaneously
- May share resources
- Coordinate communication
- Have unified rollback plan

### Change Dependencies

Define dependencies between changes:

1. Open change request
2. Navigate to **Relationships** tab
3. Click **Add Dependency**
4. Select related change
5. Define dependency type:
   - **Blocks**: This change must complete first
   - **Blocked By**: Other change must complete first
   - **Related**: Changes are related but independent

## Resource Scheduling

### Resource Availability

Check resource availability:
1. Click **Resources** in scheduling dialog
2. View team member calendars
3. Identify available personnel
4. Assign to change tasks

### Resource Allocation

Allocate resources effectively:

- **Primary Implementation Team**: Core implementers
- **Backup Resources**: In case of issues
- **Support Staff**: For user communications
- **Monitoring Team**: Track implementation progress

## Rescheduling Changes

### When to Reschedule

Reschedule if:
- Conflicts identified
- Resources unavailable
- Dependencies not met
- Business priorities change
- Risk level increases

### Rescheduling Process

1. Open scheduled change
2. Click **Reschedule**
3. System releases current time slot
4. Select new date/time
5. Recheck conflicts
6. Notify stakeholders
7. Update change calendar

### Rescheduling Notifications

Automatic notifications sent to:
- Change requestor
- Implementation team
- Approvers
- Affected users
- Management (for critical changes)

## Change Freeze Periods

### What is a Change Freeze?

Temporary halt on all non-emergency changes during critical periods.

### Implementing Change Freeze

1. Announce freeze period in advance
2. Complete pending changes before freeze
3. Set freeze dates in system
4. Define emergency approval process
5. Communicate to all stakeholders

### Managing During Freeze

- Only emergency changes permitted
- Requires executive approval
- Full CAB review post-implementation
- Extended testing requirements

## Schedule Optimization

### Best Practices

#### Spread Changes Over Time
- Avoid scheduling too many changes simultaneously
- Distribute across available windows
- Allow time for issue resolution

#### Group Related Changes
- Combine changes to same system
- Coordinate dependent changes
- Reduce total maintenance time

#### Consider Time Zones
- Schedule global changes carefully
- Minimize impact on all regions
- Rotate maintenance windows fairly

## Scheduling Notifications

### Automated Reminders

**Implementation Team**
- 7 days before: Preparation reminder
- 3 days before: Final preparation
- 1 day before: Ready check
- 2 hours before: Implementation reminder

**Stakeholders**
- 7 days before: Advance notice
- 1 day before: Final reminder
- Implementation start: Change in progress
- Completion: Change completed successfully

## Scheduling Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Schedule Adherence**: % changes completed on schedule
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Number of scheduling conflicts
- **Rescheduling Rate**: % changes rescheduled
- **Window Utilization**: % of maintenance window capacity used

### Reporting

Generate scheduling reports:
1. Navigate to **Reports** > **Change Management**
2. Select **Scheduling Analysis**
3. Choose reporting period
4. Review metrics and trends

## Integration with Other Modules
