## Request vs Incident

Understanding the distinction:

- **Incidents**: Unplanned interruptions or reductions in service quality
- **Requests**: Planned requests for services, information, or access

Requests are typically for standard services that follow a predefined fulfillment process, while incidents require investigation and troubleshooting.
