# Overview

**Scheduled Scans and Imports** provide automated, recurring discovery operations that maintain continuous visibility of IT infrastructure without manual intervention. This centralized management interface enables administrators to configure, monitor, and control all automated discovery activities from a single location.

By scheduling regular network scans and cloud imports, organizations ensure their Configuration Management Database (CMDB) remains current and accurate. Automated discovery reduces manual workload, improves data consistency, and provides timely detection of infrastructure changes, unauthorized devices, and configuration drift.

## Key Capabilities:

### Network Scan Scheduling
- Automated discovery of on-premises infrastructure
- Flexible frequency configuration (daily, weekly, custom intervals)
- Support for all probe types and scan methodologies
- Targeted IP range scanning with exclusions
- Multi-client scan distribution

### Cloud Import Scheduling
- Automated synchronization with AWS, Azure, Intune, and Meraki
- Regular updates of cloud resource inventories
- Credential-based secure access
- Service-specific import configuration
- Multi-tenant and multi-account support

### Schedule Management
- Enable/disable schedules without deletion
- Modify timing and parameters
- View execution history and related scans
- Monitor next run times and last execution status
- Bulk operations on multiple schedules

### Integration Benefits
- Continuous CMDB currency
- Reduced manual discovery overhead
- Timely detection of infrastructure changes
- Compliance and audit trail maintenance
- Resource optimization through scheduled execution

Scheduled operations execute according to configured frequency and timezone settings, with results appearing in Recent Scans (for network scans) or respective Import pages (for cloud imports). All scheduled activities maintain detailed execution logs for troubleshooting and audit purposes.
