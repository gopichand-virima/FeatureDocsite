                                            ↓
                                       Reopened ──→ (back to Assigned)
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | SLA Clock | Actions Available |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| New | Just created, awaiting assignment | Running | Assign, Close |
| Assigned | Assigned to technician/team | Running | Accept, Reassign |
| In Progress | Actively being worked | Running | Update, Escalate, Pending |
| Pending | Awaiting external input | Paused | Resume, Update |
| Resolved | Solution implemented | Stopped | Close, Reopen |
| Closed | Incident completed | Stopped | Reopen (time-limited) |

### State Transition Rules

**Allowed Transitions:**
- New → Assigned, Closed
- Assigned → In Progress, Pending
- In Progress → Pending, Resolved
- Pending → In Progress
- Resolved → Closed, Reopened
- Closed → Reopened (within 7 days)

**Blocked Transitions:**
- New → Resolved (must be assigned first)
- Pending → Resolved (must return to In Progress)

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Define Incident Categories

Navigate to **Admin → ITSM → Incident Categories**

**Standard Category Structure:**

```yaml

- Multiple users affected
- Business-critical system down
- Response: 15 minutes
- Resolution: 4 hours

**P2 - High**
- Major functionality impaired
- Significant user impact
- Workaround available
- Response: 1 hour
- Resolution: 8 hours

**P3 - Medium**
- Minor functionality impaired
- Limited user impact
- Response: 4 hours
- Resolution: 24 hours

**P4 - Low**
- Cosmetic issues
- Single user affected
- Response: 8 hours
- Resolution: 72 hours

**P5 - Planning**

### Step 3: Set Up Support Teams

Create support teams and assign members:

1. Navigate to **Admin → ITSM → Teams**
2. Create teams:

```yaml
Service Desk (Tier 1):
  Members: [15 agents]
  Responsibilities:
    - Initial triage
    - Password resets
    - Basic troubleshooting
  Skills:
    - General IT support

```

### Step 4: Configure Incident Forms

Customize incident creation forms:

**Required Fields:**
- Subject (text)
- Description (rich text)
- Requestor (user lookup)
- Category (dropdown)
- Urgency (dropdown)
- Impact (dropdown)

**Optional Fields:**
- Affected CI (CMDB lookup)
- Location (dropdown)
- Department (dropdown)
- Attachment (file upload)

**Conditional Fields:**
```javascript
if (category == "Hardware") {
  show_field("Asset Tag");
  require_field("Location");
}

if (priority == "P1") {
  require_field("Business Impact");
  show_field("Management Notification");
}
```

## Priority and Categorization

### Automatic Categorization

Use AI-powered categorization:

1. Enable **Admin → ITSM → AI Settings → Auto-Categorization**
2. Train with historical data:
   - Analyze past 1000 incidents
   - Build category prediction model
   - Review and refine

**Example AI Categorization:**
```
Incident: "Cannot access email on iPhone"
→ AI Suggests: Software > Email > Access Issues
→ Confidence: 92%
```

### Smart Priority Assignment

Auto-calculate priority based on rules:

```javascript
Rule 1: VIP Users
if (requestor.is_vip) {
  impact = "High";
  urgency = "High";
  priority = "P1";
}

Rule 2: Server Down
if (category.contains("Server") && status == "Down") {
  impact = "High";
  urgency = "High";
  priority = "P1";
  escalate_to = "Server Team";
}

Rule 3: Business Hours
if (current_time.is_business_hours) {
  urgency += 1;
} else {
  urgency -= 1;
}
```

## Assignment Rules

### Automated Assignment

Configure assignment rules:

**Rule Structure:**
```yaml
Rule: Desktop Hardware Issues
Conditions:
  - Category = "Hardware > Desktop/Laptop"
  - Priority = "P2" or higher
Actions:
  - Assign to: "Desktop Support"
  - Set: SLA = "Hardware Support SLA"
  - Notify: Team Lead
  - Add Tag: "hardware"

Rule: Server Critical
Conditions:
  - Category contains "Server"
  - Priority = "P1"
Actions:
  - Assign to: "Server Team"
  - Page: On-call Engineer
  - Create: Major Incident
  - Notify: IT Management
```

### Round-Robin Assignment

Distribute load evenly:

```javascript
Assignment Method: Round-Robin
Team: Service Desk
Criteria:
  - Agent must be available (not on break)
  - Agent has < 10 open tickets
  - Agent has appropriate skills
  - Agent is within shift hours

Rotation Order:
  1. Agent with least current assignments
  2. Agent who hasn't received ticket longest
  3. Random selection if tied
```

### Skill-Based Routing

Route based on expertise:

```yaml
Incident Category: "Database > Oracle"
Required Skills:
  - Oracle DBA
  - Minimum Level: Expert (8/10)

Eligible Agents:
  - John Smith (Oracle: 9/10) ✓
  - Sarah Lee (Oracle: 8/10) ✓
  - Mike Johnson (Oracle: 6/10) ✗

Assignment: John Smith (lowest current load)
```

## SLA Management

### Defining SLAs

Create service level agreements:

1. Navigate to **Admin → ITSM → SLA Policies**
2. Click **Create SLA**

**Example SLA Configuration:**

```yaml

    Response Time: 1 hour
    Resolution Time: 8 hours
    Business Hours: 8AM-6PM Mon-Fri
  
  P3 Medium Priority:
    Response Time: 4 hours
    Resolution Time: 24 hours
    Business Hours: 8AM-6PM Mon-Fri
  
  P4 Low Priority:
    Response Time: 8 hours
    Resolution Time: 72 hours
    Business Hours: 8AM-6PM Mon-Fri

Escalation:
  Warning: 75% of target elapsed
  Breach: 100% of target elapsed
```

**VIP Support SLA:**
```yaml
SLA: VIP Executive Support
Scope:
  - Requestor in "VIP Users" group
  
Targets:
  All Priorities:
    Response Time: 15 minutes
    Resolution Time: 4 hours
    Business Hours: 24x7
    
Actions on Breach:
  - Notify: IT Director
  - Escalate to: Senior Support
  - Create: Management Report
```

### SLA Clock Management

**When SLA Clock Runs:**
- Incident in New, Assigned, or In Progress status
- During defined business hours
- Not in Pending status

**When SLA Clock Stops:**
- Incident set to Pending
- Outside business hours (if configured)
- Incident resolved or closed
- Manual pause (requires manager approval)

**Calendar Configuration:**
```yaml
Business Hours:
  Monday-Friday: 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM
  Saturday-Sunday: Closed
  
Holidays (SLA paused):
  - New Year's Day
  - Memorial Day
  - Independence Day
  - Labor Day
  - Thanksgiving
  - Christmas Day
  
Time Zone: America/New_York
```

## Escalation Procedures

### Automatic Escalation

Configure escalation triggers:

**Time-Based Escalation:**
```yaml
Escalation Rule: SLA Warning
Trigger: SLA 75% elapsed
Actions:
  - Notify: Assigned Technician
  - Notify: Team Lead
  - Highlight: Incident in queue
  - Add Note: "SLA warning - 25% remaining"

Escalation Rule: SLA Breach
Trigger: SLA 100% elapsed
Actions:
  - Reassign: Team Manager
  - Notify: IT Director
  - Priority: Increase by 1 level
  - Create: Escalation Ticket
  - Log: Breach incident
```

**Manual Escalation:**
- Available to any agent

      - IT Management
      - Business Stakeholders
      - Communications Team
  - Create: War Room
  - Begin: Status Updates (every 30 min)
  - Invoke: Disaster Recovery (if needed)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Incident Documentation

**Required Documentation:**
- Clear, concise description
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Troubleshooting steps taken
- Resolution details
- Root cause (if identified)

**Documentation Template:**
```markdown
## Problem Description
[Clear description of the issue]

## Impact
Users Affected: [number/list]
Services Affected: [list]
Business Impact: [description]

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. [Step taken]
2. [Result]
3. [Next step]

## Resolution
[Detailed resolution steps]

## Root Cause
[If identified]

## Prevention
[Steps to prevent recurrence]
```

### 2. Knowledge Base Integration

Link incidents to KB articles:

```yaml
During Incident Creation:
  - Search KB for similar issues
  - Suggest relevant articles
  - Allow quick resolution from KB

After Incident Resolution:
  - Prompt to create KB article
  - Pre-populate from incident details
  - Link incident to article
  
KB Article Auto-Suggestion:
  When: Incident description entered
  Method: AI similarity matching
  Display: Top 3 relevant articles
  Action: One-click resolution from KB
```

### 3. Customer Communication

**Communication Guidelines:**
- Acknowledge within SLA response time
- Provide regular updates (at least every 4 hours for P1/P2)
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Set realistic expectations
- Confirm resolution with user

**Notification Templates:**
```
New Incident Created:
Subject: Incident #{{ticket_number}} - {{subject}}
Body:
  Thank you for contacting IT Support. Your incident has been 
  created with ticket number {{ticket_number}}. 
  
  Priority: {{priority}}
  Assigned to: {{assigned_team}}
  Expected Response: {{sla_response_time}}
  
  You will receive updates as we work on your issue.

Incident Resolved:
Subject: Incident #{{ticket_number}} Resolved
Body:
  Your incident has been resolved. Please verify that the issue
  is fixed and respond to this email if you need further assistance.
  
  Resolution: {{resolution_details}}
  
  This ticket will auto-close in 24 hours if no response is received.
```

### 4. Performance Metrics

**Track Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| First Contact Resolution | >70% | Incidents resolved on first contact |
| Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) | <24h | Average resolution time |
| SLA Compliance | >95% | % incidents meeting SLA |
| Customer Satisfaction | >4.5/5 | Post-resolution survey |
| Reopen Rate | <5% | % incidents reopened |
| Backlog | <100 | Open incidents >3 days old |

**Reporting:**
- Daily: Open incidents, SLA compliance
- Weekly: Team performance, backlog trends
- Monthly: Customer satisfaction, MTTR trends
- Quarterly: Category analysis, improvement areas

### 5. Continuous Improvement

**Regular Reviews:**
- Weekly team meetings - discuss challenging incidents
