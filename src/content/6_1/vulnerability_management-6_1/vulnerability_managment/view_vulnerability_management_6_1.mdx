## Viewing Vulnerability Management

Upon accessing the module, you see the main grid, which provides an overview of all tracked vulnerabilities:

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_1.png" original-image-title=""></span>

<span class="Strong">Column Details:</span>

- <span class="Strong">Name</span>: Software or product name.

- <span class="Strong">CPE Uri</span>: Standardized identifier (Common Platform Enumeration).

- <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span>: One or more linked CMDB assets (clickable for details).

### Viewing a Product

- Use the <span class="Strong">Name</span> filter to search for a specific product (e.g., <span class="Emphasis">Adobe Genuine Service</span>, <span class="Emphasis">MySQL Server 8.0</span>).

- Alternatively, filter by <span class="Strong">CPE Uri</span> or <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span>.

### Software Versions

1.  Click the <span class="Strong">Name</span> of the desired product in the Vulnerability Management page.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_2.png" original-image-title=""></span>

2.  This opens the <span class="Strong">Software/Product Version View</span>, listing:

    - <span class="Strong">CPE Uri</span> for each version.

    - <span class="Strong">Title</span> (version description).

    - One row per version known in the NVD.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_3.png" original-image-title=""></span>

If a product has only a single version listed, clicking on the product name will take you directly to the list of associated CVEs for that version.

### CVEs for a Specific Version

1.  <span class="Strong">Open the Version’s Vulnerability List</span>

    - Click a <span class="Strong">version row</span> to view its associated CVEs.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_4.png" original-image-title=""></span>

2.  <span class="Strong">Vulnerability Details List</span>

    - <span class="Strong">Title</span>: The version description of a software/product.

    - <span class="Strong">CPE URI</span>: Common Platform Enumeration Uniform Resource Identifier uniquely identifies software products, their versions, and sometimes their platforms or vendors.

    - <span class="Strong">CVE ID</span>: <span class="Strong">CVE ID</span> (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Identifier) is a unique identifier assigned to a specific security vulnerability.

    - <span class="Strong">Metric V2 Severity</span> and <span class="Strong">Metric V3 Severity: </span>Color-coded Severity,

      - HIGH = yellow

      - MEDIUM = orange

      - Critical = Red

      - Low = Green

    - <span class="Strong">Description: </span>Description of the vulnerability.

    - <span class="Strong">Last Modified Date</span>: The date the vulnerability (CVE) first appeared publicly in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), marking its initial disclosure to the public and security community.

    - <span class="Strong">Published Date</span>: The most recent date when any information about the vulnerability was updated in the NVD.

      - You can filter vulnerabilities by their published year using the <span class="Strong">Published Year</span> dropdown. This allows you to quickly view vulnerabilities that were published in a specific year.

3.  <span class="Strong">View Full CVE Details</span>

    - Click the <span class="Strong">CVE ID</span> to see:

      - Full description.

      - Reference links.

      - Known affected software configurations.

      - Reference Links: External resources for remediation.

### See Which Assets Are Affected

You can identify impacted assets (CIs) in two ways:

#### Option 1 — From the Vulnerability page

- Click the <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span> link for a product in the main page.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_6.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- A <span class="Strong">Vulnerable CIs</span> pop-up appears. Click a CI (e.g., AST003555) to open the asset in the CMDB.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_7.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Click the <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span> link to be redirected to the corresponding asset’s detail page in the CMDB.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_8.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Click the <span class="Strong">Vulnerability</span> tab to display the list of vulnerabilities associated with the asset.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_9.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Click a <span class="Strong">CVE ID</span> for full details as described above.

#### Option 2 — From the CMDB

- Go to <span class="Strong">CMDB</span> and open the desired asset record.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_10.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Click the <span class="Strong">Vulnerability</span> tab to view:

  - A list of <span class="Strong">CVE IDs</span> affecting the asset.

  - Descriptions, V2/V3 severities (color-coded), published and last modified dates.

  - Click a <span class="Strong">CVE ID</span> for full details as described above.

- When a Configuration Item (CI) is deleted from the CMDB—whether it is a main (top-level) asset or a component asset—all associated records for that CI in the Vulnerability Management module are also automatically deleted. This ensures that vulnerability data remains consistent and does not reference assets that no longer exist in the CMDB.

When searching for an Asset ID in the CMDB, it’s important to understand the distinction between main assets and components:

- If the Asset ID belongs to a <span class="Strong">component</span> (rather than a main asset), it will <span class="Strong">not appear in the main CMDB asset list</span> and cannot be searched directly from the primary CMDB search interface.

- Components are not listed as primary assets in the CMDB search results. Only main (top-level) assets are searchable and visible in the main asset grid.

#### Option 3- From the BSM View

- Go to <span class="Strong">CMDB</span> and open the desired asset record.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_11.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Click <span class="Strong">Business Service Map</span> to open the BSM view.

<span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/Vulnerability-Mngmnt/Vulnerability%20Management_1_12.png" original-image-title=""></span>

- Right-click the vulnerability icon and select <span class="Strong">"Vulnerability Information"</span> to view detailed vulnerability information. The system will redirect you to the Vulnerability Version page. From there, clicking on a specific version will display the list of vulnerabilities associated with the selected Configuration Item (CI).

<!-- -->

- If a vulnerability is present for a particular Configuration Item (CI), a vulnerability icon will be added to that CI’s record.

- Additionally, if any child CI within a hierarchy has a vulnerability, the vulnerability icon will also be displayed on both the parent and the affected child CIs.
