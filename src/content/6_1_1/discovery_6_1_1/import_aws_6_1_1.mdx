# Import from AWS

Use this function to identify information existing in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The discovery of the Amazon Web Services cloud is based on account information rather than an IP range. Discovery Servers are not used in this type of discovery.

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan > Import from AWS**. The Import AWS window displays and contains a list of all currently imported records.

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose [Import](/discovery/import_aws_record_6_1_1.mdx).

Click the **[Import](/discovery/import_aws_record_6_1_1.mdx)** icon.
