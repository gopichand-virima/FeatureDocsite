# About Event Management

## Definitions

<div class="Bullet1" madcap:conditions="Default.Omit">

**Event**. A change of state which has significance for the management of a Configuration Item or IT Service. The term Event is also used to mean an Alert or Notification created by any IT Service, Configuration Item or Monitoring tool. Events typically require IT Operations personnel to take actions and often lead to Incidents being logged.

**Alert**. A warning that a threshold has been reached, something has changed, or a failure has occurred. Alerts are often created and managed by System Management tools and are managed by the Event Management Process.

**Event Management**. The Process responsible for managing events throughout their lifecycle. Event Management is one of the main activities of IT Operations.

## Overview

Event Management provides effective service operation which depends upon knowing the status of the infrastructure and the components within. The purpose of event management is to manage events throughout their lifecycle, from detection through to determining the appropriate control action.

Monitoring and Event management are closely related but slightly different in nature. Event management focuses on generating and detecting meaningful notifications about the status of the IT infrastructure and services.

Monitoring simply watches the IT infrastructure and services, reporting on its status whether meaningful or not.

Events may be detected by a Configuration Item (CI) itself, or by a management tool polling the CI.

Any event detected may lead to an action being taken; the event could be acknowledged, may trigger an action or may lead to an Incident, Problem or Change being created.

Responses to events may be automated or may require manual intervention.
