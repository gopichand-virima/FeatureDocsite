**Primary Details (left panel)**\
Quick facts about the CI:

- **Asset ID** -- Virima's unique identifier for the discovered CI (e.g., DSC69303). Use this to search or reference the record.

- **Blueprint** -- The discovery blueprint that matched the resource (e.g., **AWS FARGATE**, **ECS**, **EC2**). It indicates the CI's class/type.

- **Created On** -- Timestamp when the CI was first created in the CMDB from discovery.

- **Last Modified On** -- The most recent time the CI's data was updated (any field change or enrichment).

- **Last Seen On**[ -- The last successful discovery of assets. If this gets old, the asset may be offline or unreachable.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 - The \"Last Seen On\" field is not available for assets imported from Cloud sources.

- **IP Address** -- Last known IP detected for the CI (blank for types that don't expose an IP).

- **Host Name** -- Host/endpoint name captured by discovery (for cloud services, often the workload/task name).

- **Authorization status** -- A badge indicating **Authorized** or **This CI is unauthorized**:

 - *Authorized* = t[he CI is recognized/approved to exist in the CMDB; ]{.inline-comment-marker}surfaced from Authorize tab of Import from AWS import records view.

 - An authorized asset always has an associated CMDB ID, such as \"**Update to \<CMDB Asset ID\>**\".

 - *Unauthorized* = the CI is new or not yet approved; typically surfaced from the *Unauthorized* tab in import views.

- **Tags**[ -- If any ]{.inline-comment-marker}\
