### Accessibility
Icons include tooltips that appear on hover, providing text descriptions of their functions. This ensures accessibility for all users.

### Responsive Design
Icons adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining visibility and usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Color Coding
Icons use Virima's brand color scheme:
- **Primary actions**: Emerald green (#10b981)

- **Warning actions**: Amber (#f59e0b)
- **Destructive actions**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Success indicators**: Green (#22c55e)

## Best Practices

1. **Hover for Information**: Always hover over icons to see their tooltip descriptions
2. **Check Permissions**: Some icons may be disabled based on user permissions
3. **Context Awareness**: Icon availability may vary based on current context or selected records
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Many icon functions have keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. **Icon Groups**: Related icons are grouped together for easier access
