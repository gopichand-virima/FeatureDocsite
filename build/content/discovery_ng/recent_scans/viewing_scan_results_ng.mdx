# Viewing Scan Results

To view the assets discovered by a scan:

1. Navigate to **Discovered Items** from the Discovery Scan menu.

2. **Filter by the scan name or date** to see which assets were found during that particular scan.

Alternatively, users can drill down from the **Recent Scans** detail page and view hyperlinks that take them directly to related **Discovered Items** records.
