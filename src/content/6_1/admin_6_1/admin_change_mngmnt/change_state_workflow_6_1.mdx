# Change State Workflow

Use this function to create a workflow. This builds series of predefined stages that a change goes through during its life cycle. By associating a change workflow with a change, the process if quicker and eliminates the need for a role with relevant access to manually change the stage/state.

Once a Change Workflow is associated to a change, the stage/state of the change is automatically made and set in the workflow, and the relevant roles are notified.

In the main window, click **Admin > Change Management > Change State Workflow**. The Change State Workflow window displays.
