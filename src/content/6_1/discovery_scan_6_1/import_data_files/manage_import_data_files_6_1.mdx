# Managing Import Data Files

**Import Data Files** lets you bulk upload configuration items to the CMDB from Excel and CSV. You upload a file, map its columns to CI fields, preview and correct the mapping, and submit. The system validates required fields, shows errors, and tracks each import with status, uploader, and time. Results are classified as authorized when they match existing items or unauthorized when they are new, so you can review them before adding them to the CMDB. You can also import relationships, export import records, and delete uploaded files before promotion.
