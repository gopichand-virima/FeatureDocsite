# Discovery Scan Configuration

Use this function to create the host configuration.

A host is determined based on the configuration defined under the host configuration. The application checks for the ports that are opened/closed on the machines based on this configuration. The application will first check (based on the rank) whether port 135 is opened or closed.


Details about Host and Credential Configuration can be found at the bottom of this topic.


In the main window, click **Admin > Discovery > Discovery Scan Configuration**. The Discovery Scan Configuration window displays.

!

Host is determined based on the configuration defined under Host configuration. The Discovery application checks for the ports that are opened/closed on the machines based on this configuration. The discovery application will first check (based on the rank) whether is port is opened or closed.

If the port is OPENED:

- The Discovery application will try to find the matching credential based on the Credential Configuration, if the credential is matched then it will determine the host as Windows.
- If none of the credentials are matched, then it will check for the next ranked port.

If the port is CLOSED:

- The application will check for the next ranked port.
- If second ranked port is closed, then it checks for the third ranked port.
- If the last ranked port is also closed, then it will display Unknown Device message.

For each platform type:

- Enter the *Rank* and *Port* numbers.
- Click **Save**.

The Discovery Scan Configuration window contains the following sections:

- Credential Configuration
- PAExec Configuration

Credential Configuration

!

The table below explains the logic of credential configuration.


| Credential Configuration | Try All Credentials | Try Matching Credentials |

| --- | --- | --- |

| Windows Domain | Performs the first two steps of **Try Matching Credentials**. If the specified domain credentials don't match, it tries the remaining Windows credentials. If none of the Windows credentials match, it will proceed with the next ranked port. | Associated window credentials will be tried first.When performing a scan for the first time, there won’t be any associated credentials for a Host. Therefore, it will perform the below step. At the end of the initial scan, a matching credential for a host(s) will be associated, and this credential will be used for subsequent scans. Windows credentials that are mapped to the specified IP address will be matched first. If none of the credentials match, it will try with the specified domain credentials. If the specified domain credentials don't match, then it will proceed with the next ranked port. |

| Windows Workgroup | Performs the first two steps of **Try Matching Credentials**. If none of the credentials match, it tries the remaining Windows credentials. If the remaining credentials don't match, it proceeds with the next ranked port. | Associated windows credentials will be tried first. When performing a scan for the first time, there won’t be any associated credential for a Host. Hence it will perform the next step. At the end of the initial scan, a matching credential for a host(s) will be associated, and this credential will be used for subsequent scans. Windows credentials that are mapped to the specified IP address will be matched first. If none of the credentials match, then it will proceed with the next ranked port. |

| **Linux / SNMP** | Performs the first two steps of **Try Matching Credentials**. If none of the credentials match, it tries the remaining Linux / SNMP credentials. If the remaining credentials don't match, it will display anUnknown Devicemessage. | Associated Linux /SNMP credential is tried first. When performing a scan for the first time, there won’t be any associated credential for a Host. Therefore, it performs the below step. At the end of the initial scan, a matching credential for a host(s) will be associated, and this credential is used for subsequent scans. Linux /SNMP credentials mapped to the specified IP address are matched first. If none of the credentials match, it proceeds with the next ranked port. |


PAExec Configuration

PAExec is a third-party, external application package inside the Virima Discovery application. It is used to help the Discovery application login into the remote Windows machines and execute the probes.


By default, some options are checked inside the Discovery Scan Configuration windows because these are mandatory settings required for performing the remote executions.


!

Default Options (Checked)

-h: If the target system is running Vista or higher, the process runs with the account's elevated token, if available.

-c: Copies the specified program to the remote system for execution. If this option is omitted, the application must be in the system path on the remote system.

-f: Forces the specified program to be copied even if the file already exists on the remote system. This is required when using c to copy files.

-u: Specifies the username for logging into the remote system.

-p: Specifies the password for the provided username.

-to: Sets a timeout in seconds. If the launched process does not exist within this time, it will be terminated.

-lo: Logs output to a specified file, such as -lo C:\Temp\PAExec.log, so that you can track the execution progress or errors.

-csrc: Allows you to specify an alternate path to copy the program from when using -c (copy). For example: -c -csrc "C:\test path\file.exe".

Optional Options (Not Checked by Default)

-e:

Does not load the specified account's profile. This option is useful if you want to avoid loading user profiles, ensuring the process runs in a clean environment.

This is not checked by default and must be selected if you want to run the process without loading the account’s profile.

-s:

Runs the process in the System account. This option is useful for processes that require elevated permissions to perform system-level operations.

This is not checked by default and must be selected if you need the process to run with system-level privileges.


Enable -e or -s only if your use case requires running without a user profile or with system-level privileges.
