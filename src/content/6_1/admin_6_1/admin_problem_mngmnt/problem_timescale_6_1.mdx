# Problem Timescale

Use this function to configure a resolution according to a priority basis.

The following applies to this function:

- A Problem must be either in Assigned, Escalated or Work-In-Progress state before the Response Time ends.
- Auto Escalation process gets triggered, when an assignee doesn't resolve a Problem from Assigned/Escalated/Work-In-Progress to Resolved/Closed state before the Resolution Time ends.
- A Problem must be either in Resolved or Closed state before the Resolution Time ends.
- Notification email can be sent either Before/After after the Response/Resolution Time violation.
- Notification email can be sent based on Users/Roles/From Record.
- Response Time and the Resolution Time are set as per the Service Level Agreements between the Client and the Service Provider.
- SLA time will not be recalculated once a Problem is created, time elapsed during the Response/Resolution Time is maintained even if Root cause CI/ Assignee is changed
- Notification Email will be sent to the application user upon SLA breach condition

In the main window, click **Admin > Problem Management > Problem Timesale**. The Problem Timescale window displays.
