# Documentation and Tester

API documents are essential for developers as they provide clear and concise information on how to interact with an API. They help to ensure developers can use the API correctly and efficiently, reducing the likelihood of errors and minimizing the time required to integrate the API into their software applications.

The Virima API document includes, such information as:

- Endpoints the API supports, such as URLs, HTTP methods, and request/response formats.
- Parameters used with each endpoint, such as query parameters and headers.
- Responses returned by the API, along with their respective status codes and message formats.
- Authentication of requests to the API, including the different authentication methods supported.
- Errors that can be returned by the API, along with descriptions of what each code means and how to handle it.
- Code snippets and examples of how to use the API in different programming languages and environments.
