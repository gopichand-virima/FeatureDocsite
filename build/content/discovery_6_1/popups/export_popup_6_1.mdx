# Export Popup

When you click **Export**, a confirmation popup displays.

**Message:** "The complete CMDB information will be generated to an Excel spreadsheet. You will receive an email when it is ready to be downloaded."

**Actions:**
- **Continue**: Proceeds with the export operation. The system will generate the Excel file and send an email notification with a download link.
- **Cancel**: Aborts the export operation and closes the popup.

The export process runs in the background, allowing you to continue working in Virima while the report is being generated.
