# Network Discovery Jobs Timeout Before Completion

**Article ID:** K000246456

**Severity:** Medium

## Issue

Network discovery jobs time out before completing the scan, especially when targeting large IP address ranges (e.g., /16 or /8 networks) or networks with high latency connections.

## Environment

- **Product:** Virima Discovery Engine
- **Versions:** 6.1, 6.1.1, NextGen
- **Discovery Methods:** Ping Sweep, SNMP, WMI, SSH
- **Network Size:** 1,000+ IP addresses

## Symptoms

- Discovery job status shows "Timeout" or "Failed - Timeout"
- Job log indicates "Maximum execution time exceeded"
- Partial discovery results with many IPs not scanned
- Job progress stuck at certain percentage (e.g., 67%)
- Subsequent discovery jobs also timeout at same point

## Cause

1. **Default Timeout Too Short** - Standard timeout (3600 seconds) insufficient for large networks
2. **Network Latency** - High latency connections slow down individual device scans
3. **Firewall Rate Limiting** - Security devices throttling scan traffic
4. **Resource Constraints** - Discovery engine lacks CPU/memory for concurrent scans
5. **Credential Delays** - Authentication attempts timing out for offline/unreachable hosts

## Resolution

### Step 1: Increase Discovery Job Timeout

1. Go to **Settings → Discovery → Advanced Settings**
2. Increase **Job Timeout:**
   - For /24 networks: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - For /16 networks: 7200 seconds (2 hours)
   - For /8 networks: 14400 seconds (4 hours)
3. Save settings

### Step 2: Split Large IP Ranges

Instead of scanning entire /16 network, split into multiple /24 subnets:

```
Before: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)

After:
- Job 1: 10.0.0.0/24 (256 IPs)
- Job 2: 10.0.1.0/24 (256 IPs)
- Job 3: 10.0.2.0/24 (256 IPs)
...
```

### Step 3: Optimize Discovery Settings

1. Go to **Discovery → Network Discovery → Settings**
2. Adjust concurrent scan settings:
   - **Max Concurrent Scans:** 50 (reduce from 100 if timing out)
   - **Ping Timeout:** 1000ms (reduce from 5000ms)
   - **SNMP Timeout:** 3000ms
   - **WMI Timeout:** 30000ms

### Step 4: Use Scheduled Incremental Discovery

Set up multiple scheduled jobs targeting different subnets at different times:

- Job 1 (Subnet A): Daily at 1:00 AM
- Job 2 (Subnet B): Daily at 3:00 AM
- Job 3 (Subnet C): Daily at 5:00 AM

### Step 5: Monitor Network Performance

```bash
# Test latency to target network
ping -c 100 target-device.local

# Check packet loss
# Should be <1% for reliable discovery
```

## Verification

- Discovery jobs complete with "Success" status
- All target IP addresses scanned
- Asset inventory reflects expected device count
- Job logs show no timeout errors
