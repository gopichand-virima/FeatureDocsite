# Additional notes on Excel import behavior

When importing scan records using an Excel sheet, the following conditions and behaviors apply:

- **Past timestamps are ignored**

 - If the timestamp specified in the Excel sheet is a past date/time, that record will **not be imported**. The system will **skip** the record to avoid scheduling outdated scans.

- **Active status handling**

 - If the Active status in the Excel sheet is set to true, the record will be stored and a scan shall be triggered at the scheduled time

 - If the Active status is set to false or left **blank**, the record will be stored but a scan will not be triggered

- **Recurring flag behavior**

 - If the Recurring field is set to true, the system treats it as a **recurring scan scheduled every year**, and the value is stored in the DB as \*.

 - If the Recurring field is set to false or left **blank**, the scan is treated as **current year only**.

- **Client status requirement**

 - The scan record will only be imported if the associated **client is active**. If the client is **inactive** or not properly configured, the system will **not import** the record.

- **Time component validation**

 - If the minute field is set to \*, the system will **not import** the record.

 - If the day field is set to \*, it will be interpreted as **every day**.

 - If the hour field is set to \*, it will be interpreted as **every hour**.

 - If the month field is set to \*, it will be interpreted as **every month**.

 - If the weekdays field is set to \*, it will be interpreted as **every week**.

You can use either the month or weekdays field --- **not both** simultaneously.

- **Only numeric values** are accepted in the month and weekdays fields. **Alphabetic representations (e.g., \"Jan\", \"Mon\") are not allowed** and will result in import failure.

1. **Cron Expression (human-readable)**

 - This line summarizes the schedule you build with the wheels below (e.g., *"at 2, 5 and 6 minutes at 0, 2, 3, 6 and 7 hours"*).

 - Treat it as a **preview**: changing the wheels updates this text. Use it to sanity-check your schedule.
