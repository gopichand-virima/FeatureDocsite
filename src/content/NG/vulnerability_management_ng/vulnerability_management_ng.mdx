# Vulnerability Management

The Vulnerability Management module provides automated identification, tracking, and management of security vulnerabilities across IT infrastructure assets by integrating with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and correlating vulnerability data with Configuration Items (CIs) in the CMDB.

### Key Capabilities

- Automated vulnerability scanning and correlation with CMDB assets.

- Integration with NVD (National Institute of Standards and Technology) database.

- Scheduled vulnerability assessments.

- Multi-level drill-down from software to version to specific vulnerabilities.

- Direct linkage between vulnerabilities and affected assets.

- Severity-based vulnerability categorization.
