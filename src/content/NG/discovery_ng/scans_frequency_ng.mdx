# Scan Frequency

Use this function to set the details for a scan, such as frequency, status, and occurrence.


The Scan Frequency window displays in different layout configurations throughout the application; however, the functionality remains the same across the application.


In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scans > Scheduled Scans**. The window displays a list of all currently scheduled scans.

Select a scheduled scan for which the frequency should be modified. The Detail window displays.

Do any of the following:

- Modify any of the existing details, such as the scan frequency.
- Click **Related Scans** to view all scans associated with this scan.
- Manage any [Tasks](/itsm/release_mngmt/tasks_ng.mdx), [Comments](/discovery/comments_ng.mdx), or [Attachments](/discovery/attachments_ng.mdx).
- View the **Log** to see any hosts.
- To export the scan information, click **Export Scan Report**. The report is emailed to the user logged into the application.

When all selections/entries are made, click **Update**.
