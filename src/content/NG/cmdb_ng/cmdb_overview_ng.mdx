# CMDB Overview

The **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** in Virima serves as a centralized repository for managing and tracking **Configuration Items (CIs)**—the essential components of an IT environment. It offers a structured view of all hardware and software and their interrelationships, enabling organizations to maintain visibility and control over their IT infrastructure.

Through the CMDB interface, each CI features a detailed profile that includes technical attributes, ownership, linked components, audit history, and lifecycle information. This allows IT teams to trace dependencies, understand service impacts, and ensure accurate asset tracking.

By leveraging the CMDB, organizations can achieve:

- **Complete asset visibility** – Unified access to technical and business details of every CI.
- **Relationship mapping** – Clear visualization of interdependencies among assets.
- **Lifecycle management** – Oversight of changes, maintenance, and vulnerabilities over time.
- **Audit and compliance support** – Reliable audit logs and change records for governance.
- **Operational efficiency** – Improved incident, problem, and change management processes through accurate, up-to-date data.

In essence, Virima's CMDB lays the foundation for effective IT service management by ensuring consistent, transparent, and actionable insights into the IT environment.
