- Deleting an item is permanent and cannot be undone. Understand the potential effects before deleting an item.

- Deleting an imported Azure Import run will remove all corresponding discovered items from both the Import from Azure page and the Discovered Items page.

- If any discovered items from the selected Azure Import run have already been moved to the CMDB, those records will not be deleted---they will remain in the CMDB but will no longer appear in the Import from Azure or Discovered Items pages.
