# Overview

The **IPAM Networks** feature in Virima offers a comprehensive approach to managing IP addresses across the network infrastructure. By integrating with Infoblox appliances, this functionality provides centralized tracking of IP address allocations, subnet utilization, and host associations.

IPAM (IP Address Management) simplifies network administration by automating the discovery and synchronization of IP-related data. This ensures accurate documentation of which devices are using specific IP addresses, supports compliance audits, and helps optimize network resource allocation. The feature also aids in conflict resolution and simplifies the planning of network expansions.
