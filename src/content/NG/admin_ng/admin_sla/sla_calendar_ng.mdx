# SLA Calendar

Use this function to manage calendars that define business hours for SLA calculations.

SLA calendars determine when SLA timers are active, accounting for business hours, holidays, and time zones. Different SLAs can use different calendars to support various service levels and global operations.

In the main window, click **Admin > SLA Management > SLA Calendar**. The SLA Calendar window displays.

## Overview

SLA calendars are used to:

- Calculate SLA timeframes accurately
- Account for non-business hours
- Handle holidays and exceptions
- Support multiple time zones
- Differentiate service tiers (24/7 vs business hours)

Multiple calendars can be created for different:

- Time zones
- Support tiers (Gold = 24/7, Silver = Business Hours)
- Regional offices
- Vendor support hours
