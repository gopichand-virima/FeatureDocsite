# Process Software Installation

The [Process Software Installation]{.Strong} action identifies and updates software installation details for selected Configuration Items (CIs). This ensures the CMDB contains accurate information about installed applications, their versions, and associated licensing data.

To run the [Process Software Installation]{.Strong} job, scanned discovery data must be available in the CMDB. Without this data, software installation details cannot be processed accurately.

1. Open the [CMDB]{.Strong} module in Virima.

2. Select the CIs for which you want to identify software installations.

3. Click the [Select Actions]{.Strong} dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

4. Choose [Process Software Installation]{.Strong} from the dropdown.

5. The system collects installed software data for the selected CIs.

6. It records application names, versions, vendors, and other related details.

7. Updated software installation data is stored in the CMDB.

8. Review the information in the CI details or relevant CMDB reports.

9. Monitor progress and completion via the [Sync Logs]{.Strong} page if processing runs in the background.
