# Report Properties and Conditions

Use this function to add properties and conditions to apply to the report.


When adding report properties, at least one display field and one condition must be selected before moving to the next step in the process.


## Example Scenario

The following is an example of generating a report to show what user accounts were created before a specific date.

The **Display field** selections are:

- Users - First Name
- Users - Last Name

The **Condition** selections are:

- Users - Active / Equals / True

*AND*

- Users - Created on / Less Than / Today

Do any of the following: 

- Use the **+** icon to add the **AND** argument.
- Click the and button to add the AND argument
- Use the **!** icon to add the **OR** argument.
- Click the or button to add the OR argument
- Click the **X** to delete the row.
- Click the **bin** icon to delete the row.

To edit the selections/entries at any time, click the **Details** tab.

To edit the selections/entries at any time, select the applicable report and click the **Details** tab.

In the pane on the left, navigate to the applicable property group (such as **Admin > Users**) and locate the applicable property.

- To add a **property** (display field), click and drag the selection to the upper pane on the right.
- To add a **condition**, select an item in the left pane.
- Click and drag the selection to the lower pane on the right.

Click **Save and Continue**. The window refreshes with the **Details** and **Run Reports** tabs displayed. By default, the Run Reports tab is selected.

Follow the instructions for [Run Reports](/reports/reports_run_5_13.mdx) to continue the process.
