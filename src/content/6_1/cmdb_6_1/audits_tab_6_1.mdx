# Audits

The **Audits** tab in the CMDB allows users to define and manage audit schedules for Configuration Items (CIs). Audits ensure the **integrity and accuracy** of CI data through periodic checks.

- Click on **New Audit** to add new audit.


- Enter the details, then click **Add** to save the new audit.
- Select one audit and click **Delete** to delete the audit.

**Key functionalities:**

- **Audit name**: Assign a meaningful label to indicate the audit's purpose (e.g., "detail check," "OS validation").
- **Add description**: Describe the audit's scope or objective.
- **Assign auditor**: Designate a user responsible for executing or reviewing the audit. Multiple users can be assigned.
- **Set recurring frequency**: Choose how often the audit should recur (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
- **Duration (in days)**: Specify the audit's validity duration or completion window.

**Example scenario:**

For an audit named **"detail check"**:

- It will run **daily**.
- It has a **duration of 7 days**.
- The assigned auditor is **Auditor Name**.
- The audit's description is **"check details."**

This setup enables timely verification of asset configurations and promotes regular CI hygiene practices.
