# ITSM

- The ITSM (IT Service Management) tab displays all ITSM records associated with a Configuration Item (CI).

- This view allows you to track the CI’s involvement in service-related activities across various ITSM modules.

- This integration supports platforms like Virima, ServiceNow, Ivanti, and Jira, with toggles to filter records based on the selected source.
