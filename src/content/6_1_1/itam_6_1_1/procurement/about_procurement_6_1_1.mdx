# About Procurement

Procurement in IT Asset Management (ITAM) is the process of managing and tracking the acquisition of hardware and software assets within an organization. It ensures that all asset requests, purchases, receipts, and transfers are efficiently documented and aligned with business and compliance requirements.

In the navigation pane, select **ITAM** > **Procurement**. The menu expands and displays the following options:

- [Requested Items](/itam/procurement/req_items_6_1_1.mdx)
- [Purchase Order](/itam/procurement/po_6_1_1.mdx)
- [Purchase Order Line Items](/itam/procurement/po_line_items_6_1_1.mdx)
- [Receiving Slips](/itam/procurement/recv_slip_6_1_1.mdx)
- [Receiving Slip Lines](/itam/procurement/recv_slip_lines_6_1_1.mdx)
