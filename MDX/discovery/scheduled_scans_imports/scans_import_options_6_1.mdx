# Scans and Import Options

- Four options can be seen at the top—each representing a different scan or import type (such as Scans, AWS, Azure, and Meraki).
- Only one option can be selected at a time
- When you select an option, both the available actions in the drop-down menu and the details displayed in the table below are updated to reflect the context of the selected scan or import type.
- This ensures that all actions and information shown are specific to your current selection, providing a focused and relevant user experience.
