|     | There are several types of dashboards throughout the application.  For example, under ITSM, each management function has its own dashboard, as does ITAM Configuration Management. *Refer to those individual sections for details.* |

From the navigation pane, select **My Dashboard**. The My Dashboard window displays.

## User Data

The upper portion of the windows contains user-related data such CIs, requests, problems, incidents, changes, knowledge items and known errors.
