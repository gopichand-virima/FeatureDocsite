# Imported Asset Details Page

When viewing an imported asset in Virima, the page displays structured information across multiple sections, allowing administrators to review, validate, and take further actions such as moving the asset to the CMDB or rescanning.

- Clicking the hyperlinked CI ID under CI column will display the corresponding record in CMDB.

!

- If we click on any other column values regardless of whether CI exists in CMDB or not, the user is redirected to Imported Assets view to view the imported asset data.

!

# **Header Section**

- **Asset ID**: Unique identifier assigned to the imported asset (e.g., **IMP001277**).
- **Move to CMDB Button**: Pushes the asset record into the Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
  - The record will appear greyed out while the imported asset is being moved to the CMDB. Once the move is complete, the asset will be removed from the Imported Assets list.
  - During this process, the system displays the progress message “import item is being processed” and automatically redirects the page to the imported asset’s details.

!

- **Rescan Now Button**: Triggers an immediate re-scan of the asset to validate or update its details.
  - Select the **Client** and **Type of scan** from the dropdown menus and then Click **Scan** to initiate the rescan.
  - The system will display a success message and redirect you to the Recent Scan page.

!

Multiple tabs are available to provide deeper insights into the asset:

- **Details** (default view) – Displays primary information, hardware, lifecycle, and network adapter details.
- **Components** – Shows associated components for the asset.
