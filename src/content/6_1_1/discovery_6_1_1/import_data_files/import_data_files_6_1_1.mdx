# Import Data Files

Use this function to import details of CI, CI relations, and asset details in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan > Import Data Files**. The Import Data Files window displays.


Edit Imported Data Files

When an asset record is selected, the Details window displays. While the content cannot be edited, the following can be done:

- [Move to CMDB](/discovery/move_cmdb_6_1_1.mdx)
- [Rescan Now](/discovery/rescan_now_6_1_1.mdx)
- View [Tasks](/itsm/release_mngmt/tasks_6_1_1.mdx), [Comments](/discovery/comments_6_1_1.mdx), and [History](/common_topics/history_6_1_1.mdx)
- View [Updates](/common_topics/updates_6_1_1.mdx)

Other information may be shown, and varies by asset. For example:

- If the asset is *Software*, a *Components* option (if shown) may contain sub-components, such as *Software License Keys* and *IP Connections*. This information is view only.
- If the asset is *Windows Host*, a *Components* option (if shown) may contain sub-components, such as Network Adapters and IP Connections. This information is view only.

The Imported Data Files window is a list of assets pulled in by an import process. Therefore, these asset records cannot be deleted.
