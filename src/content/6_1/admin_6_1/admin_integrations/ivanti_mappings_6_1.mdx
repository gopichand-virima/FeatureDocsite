# Ivanti Mappings

Use this function to map properties between a Virima Blueprint and an Ivanti CI Type.


There must be a [Ivanti Credential](/admin_integrations/ivanti_credentials_6_1.mdx) configured before a mapping can be done.


In the main window, select **Admin > Integrations > Ivanti Mappings**.

New Mapping

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **New Ivanti Mapping**.

From the drop-down lists, select the *Ivanti CI Type*, *SubType* and *Category*.

Click **Add New Sub Type**, Add New Ivanti Sub Type window displays.

Search and select the new sub Ivanti sub type.

**Is Enabled** status indicates whether the mapping is active (true/false). A blueprint will only copy from Virima to Ivanti if its mapping has the "Is Enabled" status set to True.

For the **Virima Blueprint**, enter a *Property* and *Operator*.

Choose the *Virima Blueprint* from those available in the drop-down list.

To include additional property mapping(s), click "and" or "or" and enter the additional mapping details.

Under Ivanti Property Mappings:

Click **Add**.

From the drop-down lists, select the *Virima* and *Ivanti Properties*.

Enter a property *Value*.

Check to apply the *Correlator* option.

When you select Correlator, it checks for duplicates. Only one value will be copied or moved. If duplicates include empty values, the sync will fail for that property.

Check to apply the *Reverse Sync* option.

Select the Reverse Sync option if you want to copy values from Ivanti to Virima for the mapped property during synchronization.

When all selections/entries are made, click the **Add** button.

Clone Mappings

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Clone Mapping**.

Use the checkboxes to select the records you want to clone.

The selected mappings will be duplicated and added to the list.

Re-Sync Metadata

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Re-Sync Metadata**.

Use the checkboxes to select the records you want to re-sync.

This action will re-pull the latest metadata and mapping details from the connected Ivanti instance.

It ensures that any recent updates or changes in Ivanti are accurately reflected in the system.

Reset Mapping

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Reset Mapping**.

Use the checkboxes to select the records you want to Reset.

This action will reset all mappings to their default configuration.
