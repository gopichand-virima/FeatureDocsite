# My Dashboard

Use this function to view user-related data and selected reports.


There are several types of dashboards throughout the application. For example, under ITSM, each management function has its own dashboard, as does ITAM Configuration Management. *Refer to those individual sections for details.*


In the navigation pane, select **My Dashboard**. The My Dashboard window displays.

## User Data

The upper portion of the windows contains user-related data such as [CIs](/itsm/config_mngmt/about_conf_mngt_6_1.mdx), [requests](/itsm/request_fulfillment/requests_6_1.mdx), [problems](/itsm/problem_mngmt/problems_6_1.mdx), [incidents](/itsm/incident_mngmt/incidents_6_1.mdx), [changes](/itsm/change_mngmnt/changes_6_1.mdx), [knowledge items](/itsm/knowledge_mngmt/about_knowledge_mngmnt_6_1.mdx), and [known errors](/itsm/problem_mngmt/known_errors_6_1.mdx).


The list at the top of the window cannot be changed or removed as this information displays other data collected throughout the application. However, the details for a line item can be viewed by clicking on the item.


!

Click **Show All** to display all items for the selected category (such as CIs, Requests, and so forth).

## Reports

The lower area of the window shows all reports that have been added (examples are shown below).

To manage dashboard contents, click [Add Contents](/my_dashboard/dashboard_add_contents_new_6_1.mdx).
