# Delete

The **Delete** action enables the removal of selected CIs from the CMDB.

1. Click the **Select Actions** dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

2. Choose **Delete** from the dropdown.

3. Users must select at least one CI before triggering this action.

4. A confirmation prompt will appear to avoid accidental deletions.

- Click **Yes **to confirm the deletion.


- Once deleted, the CI is removed from the active CMDB view and cannot be used in further operations.

**Note**: Use this option carefully, especially in production environments. Deleted CIs may need to be re-imported or rediscovered.
