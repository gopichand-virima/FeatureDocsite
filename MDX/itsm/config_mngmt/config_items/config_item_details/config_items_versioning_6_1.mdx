# CI: Versioning

The versioning of a configuration item starts from Production status and when changes are made in the CI, the version increments by 0.1.


You cannot set a version as a baseline which was versioned due to one of its components.


Below are the conditions that versions a configuration item:

- Changing one or more property values of a CI
- [Adding a New Property](/admin_sacm/add_new_property_6_1.mdx)
- Adding a [new CI Component](/itsm/config_mngmt/config_items/config_item_new_6_1.mdx), for example, a Software Instance, Network Adapter, etc.
- Removing a component from a CI

If the first two conditions (mentioned above) happen in any of the CI components, both the CI Component and the CI are versioned.
