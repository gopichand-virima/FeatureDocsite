# Known Errors

Known Errors are problems with documented root causes and workarounds that provide temporary relief until a permanent fix can be implemented.

## What is a Known Error?

A Known Error is a problem where:
- Root cause has been identified
- Workaround has been documented
- Permanent fix is pending or planned
- Information is published for support staff

## Creating Known Errors

### From Problem Record

1. Complete root cause analysis
2. Document the workaround
3. Open problem record
4. Click **Create Known Error**
5. Complete known error form:
   - Symptoms
   - Root cause
   - Workaround steps
   - Limitations
   - Affected systems/versions
6. Publish to knowledge base

### Known Error Contents

**Symptoms Section:**
- How the problem manifests
- Error messages
- User experience
- System behavior

**Root Cause:**
- Technical explanation
- Why it occurs
- Conditions that trigger it
- Environmental factors

**Workaround:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- How to apply
- When to use
- Expected results
- Time to apply

**Limitations:**
- What the workaround doesn't fix
- Side effects
- Temporary nature
- Performance impact

**Permanent Fix Status:**
- If fix is planned
- Expected timeline
- Change request number
- Implementation status

## Known Error Database

Centralized repository of all known errors.

### Accessing the Database

1. Navigate to **Problem Management**
2. Select **Known Error Database**
3. Browse or search for known errors

### Searching Known Errors

**Search Methods:**
- **Keyword Search**: Search symptoms or error messages
- **Category**: Filter by type
- **Affected CI**: Find by system/application
- **Date Range**: Recent vs. historical

**Quick Search:**
Support staff can quickly search while working incidents

### Using Known Errors

**During Incident Resolution:**
1. Search known error database
2. Find matching symptoms
3. Apply documented workaround
4. Link incident to known error
5. Track for permanent fix

**Benefits:**
- Faster resolution
- Consistent workarounds
- Reduced escalations
- Better user experience

## Managing Known Errors

### Status Tracking

**Active:**
- Workaround available
- No permanent fix yet
- In use by support staff

**Fix in Progress:**
- Change created
- Implementation planned
- Testing underway

**Resolved:**
- Permanent fix deployed
- Problem eliminated
- Workaround no longer needed

**Obsolete:**
- System decommissioned
- No longer relevant
- Archived for reference

### Updating Known Errors

Keep information current:

1. **When Workaround Changes:**
   - Update instructions
   - Test new workaround
   - Notify support staff
   - Version the documentation

2. **When Permanent Fix Identified:**
   - Update fix status
   - Link to change request
   - Set implementation date
   - Notify stakeholders

3. **When Fix is Implemented:**
   - Change status to Resolved
   - Test thoroughly
   - Update linked incidents
   - Archive known error

## Workaround Documentation

### Writing Effective Workarounds

**Clear Instructions:**
- Step-by-step format
- Numbered steps
- Plain language
- Screenshots if helpful

**Prerequisites:**
- Required permissions
- Tools needed
- Skills required
- Time estimate

**Procedure:**
1. Detailed steps
2. Expected results at each step
3. Troubleshooting tips
4. What to do if it doesn't work

**Validation:**
- How to verify workaround applied
- Expected behavior after applying
- What to test

### Example Workaround

**Problem:** Email sending fails with "Connection refused" error

**Workaround:**
1. Close email application completely
2. Open Windows Services (services.msc)
3. Locate "Email Client Service"
4. Right-click and select "Restart"
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Re-open email application
7. Test sending email

**Expected Result:** Email sends successfully

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

**Limitations:**
- Temporary fix only
- May need to repeat daily
- Root cause (memory leak) remains

## Known Error Lifecycle

### Creation
- Problem root cause identified
- Workaround documented
- Known error created
- Published to database

### Active Use
- Support staff apply workaround
- Incidents linked to known error
- Usage tracked
- Feedback collected

### Fix Development
- Permanent solution designed
- Change request created
- Testing performed
- Implementation planned

### Resolution
- Fix deployed
- Problem eliminated
- Known error closed
- Incidents updated

### Archive
- Retained for historical reference
- Lessons learned captured
- Process improvements identified

## Metrics and Reporting

### Known Error Metrics

**Effectiveness:**
- Workaround success rate
- Time saved in incident resolution
- Number of incidents resolved using workaround
- User satisfaction with workaround

**Volume:**
- Total active known errors
- New known errors per period
- Resolved known errors
- Age of open known errors

**Impact:**
- Incidents prevented
- Escalations avoided
- Support cost savings
- Business impact reduction

### Reporting

Access known error reports:

1. Navigate to **Reports** > **Problem Management**
2. Select **Known Error Reports**
3. Choose report type:
   - Known Error Inventory
   - Workaround Effectiveness
   - Age Analysis
   - Category Distribution

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Clear and concise
- Tested and verified
- Regularly updated
- Easy to follow

### Accessibility
- Easy to search
- Categorized properly
- Tagged appropriately
- Available to support staff

### Maintenance
- Review regularly
- Update as needed
- Archive obsolete
- Track effectiveness

### Communication
- Notify of new known errors
- Alert when workarounds change
- Announce when fixes deployed
- Share success stories

## Integration with Incident Management

### Linking Incidents

When applying workaround:

1. Open incident
2. Navigate to **Related Records**
3. Link to known error
4. Apply workaround
5. Document in work notes
6. Notify user
7. Track for permanent fix

### Incident Trending

Identify problem patterns:
- Multiple incidents with same symptoms
- Consider creating known error
- Provides faster resolution
- Reduces support load
