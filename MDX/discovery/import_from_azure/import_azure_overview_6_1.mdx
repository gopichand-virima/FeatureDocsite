# Overview

The **Import from Azure** function enables direct discovery and import of cloud resources from Microsoft Azure into Virima’s CMDB. Unlike traditional IP-range scans, this feature connects securely to Azure accounts using credentials and APIs to retrieve an accurate, real-time inventory of services and configurations.

By leveraging Azure metadata and account permissions, organizations can eliminate the need for separate discovery servers while maintaining an up-to-date inventory of assets. This approach streamlines cloud resource management, ensures continuous synchronization with the live Azure environment, and reduces administrative overhead.
