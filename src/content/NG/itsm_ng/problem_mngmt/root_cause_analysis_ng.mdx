# Root Cause Analysis

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the underlying causes of problems to prevent recurrence.

## What is Root Cause Analysis?

RCA goes beyond addressing symptoms to find and fix the fundamental cause of problems. It answers the question: "Why did this problem occur?"

### Goals of RCA

- Identify true root cause, not just symptoms
- Prevent problem recurrence
- Improve system reliability
- Build organizational knowledge
- Reduce future incidents

## RCA Process

### Step 1: Define the Problem

Clearly describe what happened:

**Problem Statement Should Include:**
- What is the problem?
- Where did it occur?
- When did it happen?
- Who/what is affected?
- How was it discovered?
- What is the business impact?

**Example:**
"The customer portal became unavailable on Nov 25, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM, preventing 1,500 customers from placing orders, resulting in estimated $50,000 revenue loss."

### Step 2: Collect Data

Gather comprehensive information:

**Data Sources:**
- Incident reports
- System logs
- Error messages
- Monitoring data
- User reports
- Configuration changes
- Performance metrics
- Timeline of events

**Documentation:**
- Collect all available evidence
- Preserve logs and screenshots
- Interview witnesses
- Record environmental conditions
- Note any recent changes

### Step 3: Identify Possible Causes

Brainstorm potential causes:

**Categories to Consider:**
- **People**: Human error, training gaps, communication failures
- **Process**: Inadequate procedures, missing steps, workflow issues
- **Technology**: Hardware failure, software bugs, configuration errors
- **Environment**: Power, cooling, network, facilities

**Techniques:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Review similar past incidents
- Consult experts
- Use cause-and-effect diagrams

### Step 4: Identify Root Cause

Determine the fundamental cause:

**Verification Criteria:**
- If this cause is eliminated, will the problem recur?
- Is this truly a cause or just a symptom?
- Is there a deeper underlying cause?
- Can this be proven with evidence?

### Step 5: Recommend Solutions

Develop corrective actions:

**Solution Types:**
- **Immediate**: Stop recurrence now
- **Short-term**: Temporary fixes
- **Long-term**: Permanent solutions
- **Preventive**: Avoid similar problems

### Step 6: Implement Solutions

Execute the fix:

- Create change requests
- Test proposed solutions
- Implement changes
- Monitor effectiveness
- Document results

## RCA Techniques

### 5 Whys

Ask "Why?" five times to dig deeper:

**Example:**
1. **Why** did the portal fail? → Database connection timeout
2. **Why** did connections timeout? → Connection pool exhausted
3. **Why** was the pool exhausted? → Too many concurrent users
4. **Why** were there too many users? → Marketing campaign launched
5. **Why** wasn't system scaled? → Change not communicated to IT

**Root Cause**: Lack of communication between marketing and IT

### Timeline Analysis

Create chronological event sequence:

**Timeline Format:**
| Time | Event | System | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1:55 PM | Marketing email sent | Email System | 50,000 recipients |
| 2:00 PM | Traffic spike begins | Portal | 10x normal traffic |
| 2:05 PM | Response time degrades | Portal | From 200ms to 5s |
| 2:10 PM | First user complaints | Help Desk | Portal slow |
| 2:15 PM | Database connections maxed | Database | 100/100 connections |
| 2:17 PM | Portal becomes unavailable | Portal | Connection timeouts |

**Analysis:**
- Identify trigger event
- Track cascading effects
- Note when problem manifested
- Determine detection lag

### Comparative Analysis

Compare working vs. non-working:

**What's Different?**
| Factor | Working State | Problem State |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Load | 100 concurrent users | 1,000 concurrent users |
| Configuration | Connection pool: 100 | Connection pool: 100 |
| Traffic | Normal pattern | Spike from marketing |
| Resources | CPU 40%, Memory 60% | CPU 95%, Memory 90% |

**Conclusion:**
Configuration adequate for normal load but not for marketing-driven spikes

### Fault Tree Analysis

Work backwards from failure:

```
Portal Unavailable
├── AND: Multiple failures required
│   ├── Database unavailable
│   │   ├── OR: Any of these
│   │   │   ├── Connection pool exhausted
│   │   │   ├── Database crashed
│   │   │   └── Network failure
│   └── No failover occurred
│       ├── Failover not configured
│       └── Failover failed
```

## RCA Validation

### Verify Root Cause

**Tests:**

   - Answer should be: NO

2. **Causation Test**: Does this cause directly lead to the problem?
   - Answer should be: YES

3. **Sufficiency Test**: Is this cause alone sufficient to create the problem?
   - May be YES or NO (multiple contributing factors)

4. **Evidence Test**: Do we have evidence proving this is the cause?
   - Answer should be: YES

### Peer Review

Have RCA reviewed by:
- Other problem analysts
- Subject matter experts
- Management
- Change advisory board
