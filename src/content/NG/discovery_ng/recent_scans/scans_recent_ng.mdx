# Overview

The **Recent Scans** function provides IT teams with a centralized view of discovery scan activities across the infrastructure. It displays real-time and historical scan data, including status, duration, runtime, and completion details, through an easy-to-use dashboard. By offering transparency and traceability, this feature helps administrators monitor discovery processes and troubleshoot failures.

Recent Scans serves as a record of all past scans, whether they were executed on-demand or as part of a scheduled job. From this page, users can review scan results, export reports, rerun scans, or drill down into logs for detailed diagnostic information. This feature ensures that network visibility remains accurate and that asset data is consistently synchronized with the CMDB.
