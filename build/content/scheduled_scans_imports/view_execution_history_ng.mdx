# Viewing Execution History

To see past executions of a scheduled job:

- **For Scans:** Navigate to **Recent Scans** and filter by the scheduled scan name or date.
- **For Imports:** Navigate to the respective import page (e.g., **Import from AWS**, **Import from Azure**) and review import records tied to the scheduled job.

Each execution is logged with:

- Execution time
- Duration
- Status (Completed, Failed)
- Number of items discovered or imported
