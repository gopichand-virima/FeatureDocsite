# About Problem Management

Problem Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems. The primary objectives of Problem Management are to:

<div class="Bullet1">

Prevent problems and resulting incidents from happening.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Eliminate recurring incidents.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented.

</div>

## Process Definition

Problem Management includes the activities required to diagnose the root cause of incidents and to determine the resolution to those problems. It is also responsible for ensuring that the resolution is implemented through the appropriate control procedures.

## Objectives

<div class="Bullet1">

Provide a consistent process to track Problems that ensures:

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Problems are properly logged.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Problems are properly routed.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Problem status is accurately reported.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Queue of unresolved Problems is visible and reported.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Problems are properly prioritized and handled in the appropriate sequence.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Resolution provided meets the requirements of the SLA for the customer.

## Definitions

**Reporter**. A person who is requesting for a problem case to be opened.

**Method of Notification**. The mode of medium used by the reporter to report a problem. The following are modes by which the Reporter can report a problem (however, this can customized):

<div class="Bullet1">

Phone

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

E-Mail

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Event Management

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Web

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

RFC

</div>

**Callback Method**. The preferred method to callback the reporter. The following are the modes of callback:

<div class="Bullet1">

Phone

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Email

</div>

**Category**. Denotes to which group of IT domain the issue is related to. The following are the categories:

<div class="Bullet1">

Desktop Hardware

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

## User Administration

**Impact Level**. The measure of the effect of a Problem on the Business Process. Impact is used to assign the priority.

There are three grades of impact:

<div class="Bullet1">

3- Low: One or two personnel. Service is degraded but still operating within SLA specifications.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

2- Medium: Multiple personnel in one physical location. Service is degraded and still functional but not operating within SLA specifications. It appears the cause of the Problem falls across multiple service provider groups.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

1 – High: All users of a specific service. Personnel from multiple agencies are affected. Public facing service is unavailable.

</div>

**Urgency**. A measure of how long it will be until an Incident, Problem or Change has a significant Impact on the Business. For example a high impact problem may have low urgency, if the impact will not affect the business until the end of the financial year. Impact and Urgency are used to assign Priority.

There are three grades of urgency such as:

<div class="Bullet1">

Low

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Medium

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

High

</div>

**Priority**. A Category used to identify the relative importance of a Problem. Priority is based on Impact and Urgency, each level of priority has a specified SLA within which the problem needs to be resolved.

There are five grades of priority:

<div class="Bullet1">

1-Very High

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

2- High

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

3-Medium

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

4-Low

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

5- Very Low

</div>

**State**. Shows the current stage in the Lifecycle of the associated problem.

There are the following statuses:

<div class="Bullet1">

New

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

On-hold

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Assigned

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Work in Progress

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Escalated

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Resolved

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Closed

</div>

**Type**. A category that determines the nature of a problem. There are the following types:

<div class="Bullet1">

Major

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Minor

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Standard

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Significant

</div>

**Assignee**. The role to whom the problem is assigned for resolution.

**Description** Gives a brief or the detailed description of the problem.

**Known Error**. An Entry that includes the symptoms related to open problems and the incidents the problem is known to create. If available, the entry will also have a link to entries in the Knowledge Base which show potential work arounds to the problem.

**Known Error Record**. As soon as the diagnosis is far enough along to clearly identify the problem and its symptoms, and particularly where a workaround has been found (even though it may not yet be a permanent resolution), a Known Error must be raised so that if further incidents or problems arise, they can be identified and the service is restored more quickly. However, in some cases it may be advantageous to raise a Known Error even earlier in the overall process – just for information purposes, for example – even though the diagnosis may not be complete or a workaround found. The known error record must contain all known symptoms so that when a new incident occurs, a search of known errors can be performed and find the appropriate match.

**Diagnosis Notes**. Steps taken to diagnose the problem are documented.

**Work Around**. In some cases, the workaround may be instructions provided to the customer on how to complete their work using an alternate method. These workarounds need to be communicated to the Service Desk so they can be added to the Knowledge Base and therefore be accessible by the Service Desk to facilitate resolution during future recurrences of the incident. In cases where a workaround is found, it is important that the problem record remains open and details of the workaround are always documented within the Problem Record.

**Test Plan**. Steps taken to monitor and test the resolution are documented.

Resolution Notes. Resolution information is documented.

**Closure code**. The act of changing the status of a problem. There are the following closure codes.

<div class="Bullet1">

Deferred

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Completed

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Canceled

</div>

**Closure Note**. Closure information is documented by the assignee.

Custom Timescale. Defines define the Response time and the Resolution time for a specific problem model /Problem. If custom timescale is not set, the system uses default timescales as defined in [Problem Timescales](../../Admin%20-%20Problem%20Mngmnt/Problem-Timescale.htm).

## Problem Policy

The Problem process should be followed to find and correct the root cause of significant or recurring incidents. Problems should be prioritized based upon impact to the customer and the availability of a workaround.

Problem Ownership remains with Quality Assurance. Regardless of where a problem is referred to during its life, ownership of the problem remains with the Quality Assurance at all times. Quality Assurance remains responsible for tracking progress, keeping users informed, and ultimately for Problem Closure.

Rules for re-opening problems. Despite all adequate care, there will be occasions when problems reoccur even though they have been formally closed. If the related incidents continue to occur under the same conditions, the problem case should be re-opened. If similar incidents occur but the conditions are not the same, a new problem should be opened. Workarounds should be in conformance with the clients standards and policies.
