# Why Schedule Scans and Imports

# **Automation**

Eliminate the need for manual scan initiation. Scans and imports run automatically based on a predefined schedule.

# **Consistency**

Ensure regular updates to the CMDB without relying on user action.

# **Off-Hours Execution**

Schedule scans during non-business hours (e.g., overnight or weekends) to minimize network impact.

# **Compliance**

Meet audit and regulatory requirements by maintaining a continuously updated inventory.

# **Proactive Monitoring**

Detect new devices, configuration changes, or missing assets in real-time through automated discovery.
