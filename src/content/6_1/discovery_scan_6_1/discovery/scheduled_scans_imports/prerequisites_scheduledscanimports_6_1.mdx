# Pre-requisites

Before configuring and running a scheduled scan in Virima, ensure you meet these requirements:

1.  <span class="Strong">Probe Availability</span>: Confirm that you uploaded the necessary discovery probes. Virima provides default probes. For specialized probes, contact Virima Support.

2.  <span class="Strong">Client Setup</span>: Install, configure, and activate the Discovery Application.

3.  <span class="Strong">Credential Configuration</span>: Add and validate all required credentials for target systems.

4.  <span class="Strong">Target Identification</span>: Define the IP addresses or hostnames to scan.

5.  <span class="Strong">Location Record (Optional)</span>: If you intend to associate scans with a specific location, create the relevant location record.

6.  <span class="Strong">Report Recipients (Optional)</span>: Only valid and active Virima users can be report recipients. Ensure all intended recipients appear in the user directory with correct email addresses and roles. Only these users will be available for selection when configuring scan notifications.

7.  <span class="Strong">Cloud Import Credentials (Meraki/Azure/AWS)</span>: For cloud imports, configure the appropriate API credentials and complete mapping accurately.
