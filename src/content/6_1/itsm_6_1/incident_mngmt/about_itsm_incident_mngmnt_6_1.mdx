# About Incident Management

Incident Management includes any event which disrupts, or which could disrupt a service. This includes events communicated directly by users through the Service Desk or an interface from Event Management to Incident Management tools.

## Goal

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and minimize the adverse impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained. ‘Normal service operation’ is defined here as service operation within SLA limits.

<p>There are three grades of impact:</p>

<p>2 - Medium – Multiple personnel in one physical location. Service is degraded and still functional but not operating within SLA specifications. It appears the cause of the incident falls across multiple service provider groups.</p>
<p>1 - High – All users of a specific service. Personnel from multiple agencies are affected. Public-facing service is unavailable.</p>

<td class="TableStyle-Alternate-Row-Color-Left-BodyD-Column1-Body2"><p>An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT Service or reduction in the Quality of an IT Service. Failure of any Item, software or hardware, used in the support of a system that has not yet affected service is also an Incident. For example, the failure of one component of a redundant high-availability configuration is an incident even though it does not interrupt the service.</p>
<p>An incident occurs when the operational status of a production item changes from working to failing or about to fail, resulting in a condition in which the item is not functioning as it was designed or implemented. The resolution for an incident involves implementing a repair to restore the item to its original state.</p>
<p>A design flaw does not create an incident. If the product is working as designed, even though the design is not correct, the correction needs to be in the form of a service request to modify the design. The service request may be expedited based on the need, but it is still a modification, not a repair.</p></td>
