# Overview

The **Import from Meraki** function enables direct discovery and import of Cisco Meraki cloud-managed network devices into Virima's CMDB. This feature connects securely to Meraki organizations using API credentials to retrieve an accurate, real-time inventory of access points, switches, security appliances, and other network infrastructure.

By leveraging Meraki's cloud-based management platform, organizations can eliminate the need for separate discovery servers while maintaining an up-to-date inventory of network assets. This approach streamlines network device management, ensures continuous synchronization with the live Meraki environment, and reduces administrative overhead for IT teams managing distributed network infrastructure.
