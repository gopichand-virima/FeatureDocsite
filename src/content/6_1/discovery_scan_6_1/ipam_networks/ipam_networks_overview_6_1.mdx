# Overview

The **IP Address Management (IPAM)** functionality in Virima provides a centralized approach to planning, tracking, and managing IP addresses, subnets, and associated assets across the network. By integrating with Infoblox, the platform enables automated updates of IP data, eliminating manual effort and reducing reliance on separate IP management tools.

With IPAM, administrators gain visibility into subnets, address allocations, host associations, and linked hardware or software, ensuring accurate records and streamlined configuration management. This capability strengthens network security, improves efficiency, and optimizes resource utilization by maintaining a clear view of IP usage and topology.
