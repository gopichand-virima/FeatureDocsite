 - [Blueprint Name]{.Strong}: Name of the Blueprint.

 - [CI]{.Strong}: CMDB CI ID matching the imported CI.

 - [Asset Name]{.Strong}: Provided Asset name.

 - [Asset ID]{.Strong}: New Asset ID is created with prefix of "IMP" to denote that this record was imported. The format is "IMP" + 6 digits (auto generated sequential number.

 - [Status]{.Strong}[: Indicates the current status of the imported asset.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 - **What it is:** CI lifecycle state (e.g., *In Use, Retired, Decommissioned*).

 - **Where it comes from:** The Status dropdown is **driven by** **Admin → SACM → CMDB Properties → Status**. The same picklist is used by **Business Rules**.

 - [Host Name]{.Strong}[: The hostname of the asset or device.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 - [Terminal ID]{.Strong}[: Optional, stored exactly as provided; not used for correlation unless your blueprint explicitly defines it.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 - [Missing Components]{.Strong}[: Lists any components that are missing from the imported asset.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 - **Missing Components:** *Not applicable* for **Imported Items**. We don't import component lists, so this field is **left blank** (or treated as **N/A**) on import. It will only be evaluated **after** a CI is **moved to CMDB** and the **Process-Missing-Components** job runs.
