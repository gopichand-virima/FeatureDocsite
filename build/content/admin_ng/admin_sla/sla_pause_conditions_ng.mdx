# SLA Pause Conditions

Use this function to configure conditions under which SLA timers should pause, ensuring fair and accurate SLA tracking.

SLA pause conditions prevent SLA breaches when delays are outside the control of the support team, such as waiting for customer response or third-party vendors.

In the main window, click **Admin > SLA Management > SLA Pause Conditions**. The SLA Pause Conditions window displays.

## Overview

SLA timers should pause when:

- Waiting for customer or requester response
- Waiting for third-party vendor
- Awaiting external approvals
- During scheduled maintenance
- When ticket is on hold for valid reasons
- Awaiting parts or equipment
- During business process delays

Pausing ensures SLA metrics accurately reflect team performance.
