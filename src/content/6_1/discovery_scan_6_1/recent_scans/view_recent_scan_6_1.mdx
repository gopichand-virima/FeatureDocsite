# Viewing a Recent Scan Page

Clicking on a specific scan entry from the **Recent Scans** table redirects users to a **detailed scan summary page**. This view provides an in-depth breakdown of scan activity, target systems, and results, useful for verification, troubleshooting, or audit purposes.

# Explanation of Sections and Fields

# Top Panel (Header Area)

- **Scan title** -- Displays the scan ID and name (e.g., *Scan Mamatha Laptop 172.16.5.187*).

- **Export scan report** -- Button to export the fu[ll scan report in formats like XLSX.]{.inline-comment-marker}

 ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Field What it shows How it's determined / example
 **Scan Range** The exact target for that row. The value you entered in *IP Range* (e.g., 192.168.40.169, 192.168.40.1-50, 192.168.40.0/24).
 **Client Name** The Discovery client/tenant that ran the scan. Selected in the job (e.g., testing1,Testing_virima).
 **Probe Name** The discovery probe used. From the job (e.g., \`Deep Host Scan WMIC)
 **Start Time** When scanning of that entry started. Shown in the **job's timezone**; e.g., 09/11/2025 08:32:39 AM.
 **Windows Hosts** Count of endpoints confidently identified as Windows. Determined via WMI/SMB fingerprint, banners, and credentials.
 **Unix/Linux Hosts** Count of endpoints identified as Unix/Linux. Determined via SSH fingerprint, OS banners, and credentials.
 **Network Devices** Count of network gear (switches/routers/firewalls/APs, etc.). Identified mainly via SNMP fingerprints/MIBs and device signatures.
 **Unknown Hosts** The targets are reachable, but none of the supplied credentials authenticated, so the OS couldn't be identified. Typical causes: missing/invalid credentials, blocked ports, partial responses.
 **Unknown Devices** Devices discovered but not fully classified (often due to missing credentials/ports). Insufficient SNMP/SSH/WMI data or atypical fingerprints.
 **Total Hosts** The sum of all counts for that entry. **Formula:** Windows + Unix/Linux + Network + Unknown Hosts + Down Hosts + Unknown Devices.

- **Auto refresh** -- Automatically refreshes the page at defined intervals.

# How to view the report

- Use filters/pivots to roll up by **Client**, **Probe**, or **Scan Range**.

- High **Unknown/Down** counts usually point to credential or connectivity gaps (check WMI/SSH/SNMP access, firewalls, and routing).

- Remember the **Start Time** reflects the **schedule's timezone**, not your current browser time.

- If you scanned multiple entries, you'll see **one row per entry**---counts are per entry (not de-duplicated across rows).

# Tabs Section

# **Details (default)**

- **Name, Probe, Client, Activity** -- who/what ran and the last action.

- **IP Range** -- targets for the run.

- **Host Details** -- quick counts (total hosts, Windows/Unix, network/unknown).

- **Run By, Location, Status, Triggered At, Completed At, Scan Duration**.

- **Results grid** (bottom): one line per discovered endpoint with filters for:

 - **IP Address, Host Name, Result, Details, Device Type, Device Summary**\
 (e.g., OS, domain/workgroup, MAC).\
 Tip: use the column filters to narrow to a device quickly.

# **Logs**

- Full execution log for the run (scrollable).

- Buttons: **Download Logs** (saves the full text) and **Refresh**.

# **Tasks**

- Add follow-up work related to this run (**New Task**) or remove tasks (**Delete**).

- Useful for assigning remediation or verification actions.

![Recent Scans 1 9](../../Resources/Images/Discovery/Recent-Scans/Recent Scans_1_9.png)

# **Comments**

- Add internal notes for this run (**New Comment**).\
 Good for handoffs or documenting exceptions.

![Recent Scans 1 10](../../Resources/Images/Discovery/Recent-Scans/Recent Scans_1_10.png)

# **Attachments**

- Use **New Attachment** to upload supporting files **for this specific record**---e.g., billing evidence, screenshots, or exported reports. The files are stored with the scan record and appear on the **Attachments** tab for easy reference.
