# Problem Priority Calculator

Use this function to configure how problem priority is automatically calculated based on urgency and impact values.

The Priority Calculator uses a matrix approach where the combination of Impact and Urgency determines the resulting Priority level.

In the main window, click **Admin > Problem Management > Problem Priority Calculator**. The Priority Calculator window displays.

## Priority Calculation Matrix

The matrix shows how priorities are calculated:

| Impact / Urgency | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
| Critical | P1 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
| High | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |
| Medium | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
| Low | P3 | P4 | P5 | P5 |

## Configure Priority Calculation

To modify the priority calculation matrix:

Click on a cell in the matrix to edit.

Select the desired priority level for that combination of Impact and Urgency.

The changes are saved automatically.

## Define Priority Levels

Configure the priority levels used in your organization:

Click **Manage Priority Levels**.

For each priority level, define:

- **Priority Name**: (e.g., P1, Critical, High)
- **Priority Level**: Numeric value (1-5)
- **Color Code**: Visual indicator
- **Target Resolution Time**: Associated resolution timeframe
- **Description**: What this priority means

Click **Save**.

## Auto-Calculate Priority

To enable automatic priority calculation:

Check **Enable Auto-Calculate Priority**.

When enabled, the priority will be automatically set based on the selected Impact and Urgency values.

Users can still manually override the calculated priority if needed.
