# Blueprints: SLA

Every Blueprint has its own SLA-defined based on its business factors. When a Root Cause CI is associated with an ITSM record, then the SLA of the blueprint is taken into consideration, provided a Custom Timescale and CI SLA *are not* defined. 

Use this function to configure response and resolution times for a CI marked as **Incident**, **Requests**, **Changes** or **Problems** that require resolution.


For System Administrators, SLA's are created through **[Admin > Others > Service Level Agreements](../Resources/Images/Admin%20-%20Other/add-sla.PNG)**.


Use this function to manage the actions that occur for an SLA.

- In the main window, select **Admin > SACM > Blueprints**. The Blueprints window displays.
- Select the record to manage. A new window displays.

!

- In the *Response Time* field, specify the maximum amount of time that can pass before a response must occur.
- In the *Resolution Time* field, specify the total time allowed to find a resolution. The Resolution Time cannot be smaller than the total of all the other response times (e.g., Response Time, 1st Level Support, etc.).
- In the *Support Level* fields, specify the amount of time allows for each support level to respond.
- In the **Escalate** section, do the following:
- For the fields in the first column, specify when an action should taken place, either **Before** or **After** the specified time duration has occurred.
- For the fields in the second column, select the amount of time that can elapse before a notification is sent to the users, roles, groups and departments specified. Multiple options can be selected.
- For the actions in the third column, click **Add** (new) or **Update** (existing) to indicate who receives a notification that activity has been escalated. *Refer to* [Searching](/common_topics/searching_6_1.mdx) *for details on how to make selections in the tabs.*
- When all selections/entries are made, click **Save**.
