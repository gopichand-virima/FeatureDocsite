## Filtering Problems

### Quick Filters

- **Open Problems**: All active problem records
- **My Problems**: Assigned to you
- **High Priority**: Critical and high priority
- **Known Errors**: Problems with documented workarounds
- **Pending RCA**: Root cause analysis not complete
- **Awaiting Change**: Fix identified, awaiting implementation

### Custom Filters

Create custom filters:

1. Click **Filter**
2. Add conditions:
   - Status
   - Priority
   - Category
   - Date range
   - Assigned group
3. Click **Apply**
4. Save filter for reuse

## Problem Workflow

### Status Lifecycle

```
New → Investigation → RCA Complete → Known Error → Resolved → Closed
```

### Status Definitions

#### New
- Just created
- Awaiting investigation
- Resources being allocated

#### Investigation
- Root cause analysis in progress
- Data being collected
- Testing underway

#### RCA Complete
- Root cause identified
- Solution being developed
- Change may be planned

#### Known Error
- Root cause documented
- Workaround available
- Published to knowledge base
- Awaiting permanent fix

#### Resolved
- Permanent fix implemented
- Change completed
- Verification in progress

#### Closed
- Problem fully resolved
- No further incidents
- Historical record

## Investigating Problems

### Root Cause Analysis

Systematic investigation:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather incident reports
   - Review system logs
   - Interview users
   - Analyze configurations

2. **Analysis**
   - Identify patterns
   - Test hypotheses
   - Recreate issue
   - Eliminate variables

3. **Root Cause Identification**
   - Document findings
   - Verify root cause
   - Test understanding
   - Validate with evidence

### Investigation Tools

**5 Whys Technique:**
Ask "why" repeatedly to dig deeper

**Fishbone Diagram:**
Visual cause-and-effect analysis

**Timeline Analysis:**
When did problem start and what changed

**Comparison:**
Working vs. non-working environments

### Documenting Investigation

Keep detailed notes:

1. Open problem record
2. Navigate to **Work Log**
3. Add investigation notes:
   - What was tested
   - Results found
   - Conclusions drawn
   - Next steps
4. Include timestamps
5. Attach supporting evidence

## Managing Known Errors

### Creating Known Error

When workaround found but no permanent fix:

1. Open problem record
2. Click **Create Known Error**
3. Document:
   - Symptoms
   - Root cause
   - Workaround steps
   - Limitations
   - Affected versions/configurations
4. Publish to knowledge base

### Known Error Database

Centralized repository:

**Contents:**
- Problem description
- Root cause explanation
- Workaround instructions
- Related incidents
- Fix status
- Preventive measures

**Benefits:**
- Faster incident resolution
- Consistent workarounds
- Reduced escalations
- Knowledge retention

### Publishing Known Errors

Make available to support staff:

1. Complete known error documentation
2. Click **Publish**
3. Select audience:
   - Internal IT only
   - Self-service users
   - Specific groups
4. Set visibility permissions
5. Enable for search

## Developing Solutions

### Temporary Solution (Workaround)

Short-term fix:

**Document:**
- Steps to apply workaround
- How it mitigates the issue
- Limitations
- When to apply
- Side effects

**Publish:**
- Known error database
- Knowledge base
- Quick reference guides

### Permanent Solution (Fix)

Long-term resolution:

**Identify Fix:**
- Technical solution
- Process improvement
- Configuration change
- Software/hardware upgrade

**Plan Implementation:**
- Create change request
- Schedule implementation
- Test in non-production
- Plan rollback if needed

**Execute:**
- Follow change management process
- Implement the fix
- Verify resolution
- Monitor for recurrence

## Problem-Change Relationship

### Creating Related Change

When fix requires change:

1. Open problem record
2. Navigate to **Related Records**
3. Click **Create Change**
4. System links change to problem
5. Complete change request
6. Track fix implementation

### Tracking Fix Progress

Monitor change status:

1. View **Related Changes** tab
2. Check change status
3. Review implementation schedule
4. Verify completion
5. Confirm problem resolution

## Problem Resolution

### Resolution Criteria

Resolve problem when:
- Permanent fix implemented
- Change completed successfully
- No new incidents occurring
- Monitoring period complete

### Resolution Process

1. **Verify Fix**
   - Test in production
   - Monitor for issues
   - Check related incidents
   - Confirm with users

2. **Update Problem Record**
   - Change status to Resolved
   - Document solution
   - Update resolution code
   - Link to knowledge article

3. **Close Related Incidents**
   - Update linked incidents
   - Apply fix if needed
   - Verify resolution

4. **Monitor**
   - Watch for recurrence
   - Track new incidents
   - Validate effectiveness

### Resolution Fields

#### Solution *
Complete description:
- What was implemented
- How it fixes root cause
- Why it works
- Any limitations

#### Resolution Code *
- **Permanent Fix**: Issue eliminated
- **Workaround Documented**: Known error remains
- **Cannot Reproduce**: Unable to verify
- **Duplicate**: Same as another problem
- **Cancelled**: No longer relevant

## Problem Closure

### Closure Criteria

- Solution verified effective
- No recurrence for monitoring period (typically 30 days)
- All related incidents resolved
- Knowledge documented

### Closure Process

1. Verify resolution effectiveness

4. Conduct post-implementation review
5. Document lessons learned

### Post-Closure Review

Analyze the problem:

**Review Topics:**
- How was problem identified
- Investigation effectiveness
- Time to resolution
- Solution effectiveness
- Process improvements
- Preventive measures

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Update procedures
- Enhance monitoring
- Improve detection
- Train staff
- Update documentation
