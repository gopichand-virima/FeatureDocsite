3. In the confirmation dialog, click **Continue**.\
 The move job runs **in the background**---no further action is required. Use **Auto Refresh** to watch status changes.

Tip: If no rows are selected, your environment will move **all records that match the current filters**. If you want to limit scope, always select the exact rows to move.

4. Upon successful move to CMDB, the records will be deleted from "Import from Meraki" and "Discovered Items" View.
