# Receiving Slip Lines

Use this function to generate receiving slip lines using a defined template for assets arriving in the stockroom. This enables tracking of assets that are arriving from different shipments.

This function also provides an alternative for creating assets before they arrive, receiving assets when they arrive, and reserving assets for the requester.

In the navigation pane, select **ITAM /> Procurement /> Receiving Slip** **Lines**. The Receiving Slip Lines window displays.
