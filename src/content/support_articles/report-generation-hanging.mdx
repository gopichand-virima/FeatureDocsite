# Report Generation Hangs or Never Completes

**Article ID:** K000246678

## Issue

Custom reports or scheduled reports hang during generation process, displaying "Generating report..." status indefinitely without completing or timing out.

## Environment

- **Product:** Virima Reporting Module
- **Versions:** 6.1+
- **Report Types:** Custom reports, Executive dashboards, Compliance reports
- **Data Volume:** Reports with 10,000+ records

## Symptoms

- Report status stuck at "Generating..." for hours
- No error message displayed
- Report never appears in completed reports list
- Scheduled reports not delivered via email
- Browser tab becomes unresponsive when generating report

## Cause

1. **Large Dataset** - Report queries returning millions of records
2. **Complex Joins** - Multiple table joins causing slow query execution
3. **Missing Filters** - No date range or status filters limiting results
4. **Inefficient Report Design** - Using calculated fields on large datasets
5. **Resource Limits** - Application timeout or memory limits exceeded

## Resolution

### Step 1: Add Date Range Filter

1. Edit report in **Reports → Custom Reports**
2. Add **Date Range** filter:
   - Filter: `created_date >= last_30_days`
   - Or: `updated_date >= last_quarter`
3. Save and re-run report

### Step 2: Limit Result Set

Add row limit to report query:

1. Go to **Report Settings → Advanced**
2. Set **Maximum Rows:** 10,000
3. Enable **Pagination:** Yes
4. Save changes

### Step 3: Schedule Report for Off-Peak Hours

Instead of generating on-demand:

1. Go to **Reports → Scheduled Reports**
2. Click **Create Schedule**
3. Set time: **2:00 AM daily** (off-peak)
4. Set **Delivery Method:** Email
5. Report generates with more resources available

### Step 4: Optimize Report Query

Replace complex calculated fields with indexed database fields:

**Before (slow):**
```
SELECT 
  assets.*,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM relationships WHERE asset_id = assets.id) as rel_count,
  (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM licenses WHERE asset_id = assets.id) as total_cost
FROM assets
```

**After (fast):**
```
SELECT 
  assets.*,
  assets.relationship_count,
  assets.total_license_cost
FROM assets
WHERE status = 'active'
AND updated_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
LIMIT 10000
```

### Step 5: Use Report Templates

Virima provides pre-optimized report templates:

1. Go to **Reports → Template Library**
2. Select template matching your needs:
   - Asset Inventory Summary
   - Software License Compliance
   - Discovery Results Summary
3. Clone and customize template
4. Pre-optimized templates run faster than custom reports

## Verification

- Report completes within 2 minutes
- Results display correctly
- Scheduled reports delivered on time
- No browser hanging or timeout errors

## Best Practices

- Always include date range filters
- Limit reports to 10,000 rows maximum
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Schedule heavy reports for off-peak hours
- Test reports with filters before scheduling
