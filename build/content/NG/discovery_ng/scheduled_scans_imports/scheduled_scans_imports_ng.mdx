# Overview

The **Scheduled Scans / Imports** feature in Virima enables IT administrators to automate recurring discovery and data import operations, ensuring that asset inventories remain continuously updated without manual intervention. By defining schedules for network scans and cloud resource imports, organizations can maintain accurate, real-time visibility into their infrastructure with minimal administrative overhead.

This feature supports both **Discovery Scans** (IP-range based scanning of on-premises or networked devices) and **Cloud Imports** (pulling resource data from AWS, Azure, Intune, and Meraki). Administrators can configure execution frequency, timing, target scope, and credentials, allowing for consistent, predictable updates to the Configuration Management Database (CMDB).

Scheduled jobs run automatically according to their configured frequency, and their execution history is tracked in **Recent Scans** or the respective **Import** pages. This approach reduces human error, improves compliance, and ensures that IT teams always have access to up-to-date asset information.
