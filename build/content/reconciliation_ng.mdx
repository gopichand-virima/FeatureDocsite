# Reconciliation

Use this function to configure and manage reconciliation rules that determine how discovered data is matched and merged with existing CMDB records.

Reconciliation is the process of identifying whether a discovered device is a new device or an existing device in the CMDB. Proper reconciliation prevents duplicate records and ensures data accuracy.

In the main window, click **Admin > Discovery > Reconciliation**. The Reconciliation window displays.

## Reconciliation Rules

Reconciliation uses identifier rules to match discovered devices with existing CMDB records. The system evaluates multiple identifiers in order of priority.

### Default Identifiers (in priority order)

1. **Serial Number**: Highest priority for hardware devices
2. **MAC Address**: Used for network devices
3. **UUID/GUID**: System identifiers
4. **Hostname + IP Address**: Combined match
5. **IP Address**: Lowest priority

### New Reconciliation Rule

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **New Reconciliation Rule**. The New Reconciliation Rule window displays.

Enter a *Rule Name* and *Description*.

Select the **Device Type** this rule applies to.

Configure the **Identifier Priority**:

- Select which identifiers to use
- Arrange them in priority order
- Set matching criteria (exact match, partial match, etc.)

Specify the **Merge Strategy**:

- Keep existing data
- Overwrite with discovered data
- Merge (combine both)

When all selections/entries are made, click **Add**.

### Edit Reconciliation Rule

Navigate to the window containing the record to edit.

Click the line containing the record. The applicable window displays.

Make the necessary modifications.

Click **Save**.

### Delete Reconciliation Rule

Click the line that contains the item to delete.

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose **Delete**.

## Reconciliation Settings

Click **Reconciliation Settings** to configure global reconciliation behavior:

- **Auto-merge threshold**: Confidence level required for automatic merging
- **Manual review threshold**: Items below this level require manual review
- **Create new CI threshold**: When to create a new CI instead of matching

## Review Reconciliation Conflicts

Click **Review Conflicts** to view devices that require manual reconciliation decisions.

Select a conflict to view:

- Discovered device data
- Potential matching CI(s)
- Similarity score

Choose an action:

- **Merge**: Combine with existing CI
- **Create New**: Create as a new CI
- **Ignore**: Skip this discovery result
