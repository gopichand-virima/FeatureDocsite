# Overview

**IPAM (IP Address Management) Networks** in Virima provides comprehensive visibility and control over IP address allocation across the enterprise network. By integrating with Infoblox DDI (DNS, DHCP, and IPAM) solutions, this feature enables IT teams to track, manage, and optimize IP address usage efficiently.

IPAM Networks helps organizations maintain accurate IP address inventories, identify available addresses, detect conflicts, and ensure compliance with network policies. The integration streamlines IP address planning, reduces manual tracking overhead, and supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address management across complex network environments.
