# Filter By

As the amount of data accumulates, it is often necessary to narrow it down to only specific data that is needed for a particular task. You can use filters to retrieve and display only the specific data that you need.

A filter is a set of conditions applied to a table in order to find and work with a subset of the data in that table. Users can apply, modify, create, save and delete filters.

   Filters are user specific.
