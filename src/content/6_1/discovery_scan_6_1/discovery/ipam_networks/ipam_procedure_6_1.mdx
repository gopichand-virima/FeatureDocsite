    After configuring Infoblox, use the IPAM functionality to manage and track IP addresses, subnets, and related network details.

    - Track the total number of subnets and IP addresses in each subnet.

    - Monitor and associate IP addresses with host names, hardware, and software information.

    - Periodically re-import resource definitions and configurations from Infoblox to maintain an accurate network inventory.
