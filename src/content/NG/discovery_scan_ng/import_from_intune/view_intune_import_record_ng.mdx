- [Move to CMDB]{.Strong} -- Promote the selected records to CMDB (Refer Move to CMDB).

- [Auto Refresh]{.Strong} -- Refresh the grid on set periodic interval. Use this when import is still in progress so that the imported items show up without manual refresh.

# Key columns

- [Blueprint Name]{.Strong} -- The discovery blueprint that matched the resource (e.g., *Intune Virtual Network*, *Intune Neo4j*)

- [Asset Name]{.Strong} -- The discovered resource name (cluster/service/task/instance, etc.).

 - The asset name is the Intune instance ID.

- [Status]{.Strong}: Indicates the current state of the CI imported from Intune. When a CI is newly imported (does not exist in CMDB), the status is shown as \"New.\"

- [Asset ID]{.Strong}: A unique, sequential identification number assigned to each discovered Intune record. The ID shall have a prefix "DSC"+ 6 digits Unique sequential number.

- [Host Name: ]{.Strong}The host or endpoint name captured by discovery.

3. In the confirmation dialog, click [Continue]{.Strong}.\
 The move job runs **in the background**---no further action is required. Use [Auto Refresh]{.Strong} to watch status changes.

Tip: If no rows are selected, your environment will move **all records that match the current filters**. If you want to limit scope, always select the exact rows to move.

4. Upon successful move to CMDB, the records will be deleted from "Import from Intune" and "Discovered Items" View.
