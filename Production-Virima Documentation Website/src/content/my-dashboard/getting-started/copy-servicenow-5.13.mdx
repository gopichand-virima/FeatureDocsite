# Copy to ServiceNow

Seamlessly transfer records from Virima to ServiceNow for integrated IT service management operations.

## Overview

The Copy to ServiceNow function enables direct integration between Virima and ServiceNow, allowing you to create and synchronize incidents, configuration items, changes, and other records across both platforms.

## Prerequisites

### Integration Requirements
Before using this feature:
- ServiceNow integration must be configured by administrator
- Valid ServiceNow instance credentials
- OAuth authentication or API key configured
- Proper user permissions in ServiceNow
- Field mapping template configured

## Copying to ServiceNow

### Transfer Process
1. Select the record to transfer
2. Click **Copy to ServiceNow** button
3. Choose the ServiceNow table (Incident, CMDB CI, Change, etc.)
4. Review and adjust mapped field values
5. Add any additional required fields
6. Click **Create in ServiceNow**

### Field Mapping
Automatic field mapping includes:
- Standard ITSM fields (priority, state, assignment)
- Configuration item attributes
- User and group assignments
- Custom field mappings (if configured)
