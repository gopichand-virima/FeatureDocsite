# User Settings

The **User Settings** page in Virima enables users to manage their personal account details and authentication options. From this page, users can update their profile information, such as name and profile image, and maintain account security by changing passwords. If Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled for the organization, users can also view or manage their SSO status.

This feature helps ensure that account details remain accurate and that users can keep their login credentials secure.

# Update User Settings

Use this procedure to manage your profile information and authentication details.

## Update Profile Information

1.  In the left navigation pane, select **User Settings**.
    
2.  On the **Profile** tab, do the following:
    
    *   **Profile Image** – Upload or update your profile picture.
