# Column Details

1. **Scan ID**: The unique identifier for a scan.

2. **Scan name**: A unique identifier for each scan, often descriptive based on location, scan type, or schedule.

3. **Status**: Indicates the outcome of each scan. Possible values include:

 - **Discovery agent completed the scan (successful)**: The master scan is marked **Completed** only after every child scan finishes and no hosts or sub lists remain pending.

 - **Scan aborted**: The user manually stopped the scan.

 - **Scan in Progress**: The scan is in progress.

 - The master scan is marked **In Progress**, if the child scan has not completed or has not been assigned a status (Success, Partial, or Failed).

3. **Triggered at**: Indicates when the scan started.

4. **Completed time**: The timestamp when the scan finished or failed. This helps track duration and performance.

5. **Duration**: The total time taken for the scan to complete. This helps identify unusually short (failed) or long (delayed) scans.

6. **Run by**: Shows which user or system triggered the scan.

7. **Rescan/Stop Scan**: Allows users to manually reinitiate or repeat a scan for a specific entry. Each row corresponds to a discovery scan, providing a shortcut to run that scan again, regardless of previous success. This column also allows users to abort an ongoing scan and initiate a rescan.

 - Rescans appear as the top entry in the recent scans table with the same Name.
