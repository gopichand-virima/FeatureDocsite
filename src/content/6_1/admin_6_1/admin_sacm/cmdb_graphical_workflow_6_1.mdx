# CMDB Graphical Workflow

The Workflow is the sequence or process through which a piece of work passes from Initiation to Completion.

In the main window, click **Admin** then navigate to required graphical configuration page for functions such as:

- Request

The Graphical Workflow window allows you to create conditions and action type showing how the workflow should proceed when events occur.

The window contains the following functions:

- **File** contains options for *New*, *Open* and *Save*.

- **Zoom In/Zoom Out** adjusts the workflow window, making the elements larger or smaller.
- Undo reverses the last action
- **Redo** reverses the last Undo action

All workflow windows contain a **Start** and **End** icon.
