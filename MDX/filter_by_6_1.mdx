# Filter By

As the amount of data accumulates, it is often necessary to narrow it down to only specific data that is needed for a particular task. You can use filters to retrieve and display only the specific data that you need.

A filter is a set of conditions applied to a table in order to find and work with a subset of the data in that table. Users can apply, modify, create, save and delete filters.


Filters are user specific.


- In a column heading, type a few letters of the search criteria.

!

- Press **Enter**. All results matching the search criteria are displayed.

!

- If necessary, enter additional search criteria in the *Search* field to further refine the list.


Multiple columns can be filtered at the same time. Enter the search criteria in each Filter field and press **Enter**.


- To apply multiple filters, type the criteria in the *Filter for* field. Then press **Enter**. Both search criteria are applied.
- To remove the search filter, click the **X** next to the filter.
- To save the filtered criteria, click **Save Filter**.
- In the Save Filter dialog box, enter a name for the filter and click **Save**.

!

- To apply a saved filter, click the **Saved Filters** icon.

!

The Filters dialog box displays with a list of all saved filters.

!

- To select the filter, click the filter name (such as Admin or CBROCK).
- To set a default, click **Set as Default**.
