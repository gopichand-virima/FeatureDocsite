# Move Assets to CMDB

The "<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Move to CMDB</span>" option in Virima allows users to move selected asset records from the Imported Assets list into the CMDB. This process ensures that only validated and relevant assets are formally tracked and managed as configuration items (CIs).

1.  Select the checkbox next to one or more asset records in the Imported Assets list.

2.  From the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions</span> dropdown, choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Move to CMDB</span>.

4.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Yes</span> to proceed.

    - The system begins processing and moves the selected records into the CMDB.

5.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">No</span> to cancel the operation.

- Wait until the record is moved; the selected record will appear grayed out during processing.

- After moving, records cannot be retrieved from the Imported Assets list.

- You can also move assets to the CMDB from the Details window.

# Re-scan Assets

The <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Re-Scan</span> feature enables users to restart the scanning process for an existing asset record. This is helpful when an asset's information has changed or was incomplete during the initial scan.

1.  Select the checkbox next to the asset record you want to revalidate in the Imported Assets list.

2.  From the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions</span> dropdown, choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Re-scan</span>.
