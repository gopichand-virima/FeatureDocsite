# Activating or Deactivating Scheduled Jobs

# **Active Status Toggle**

Each scheduled job has an **Active** checkbox:

- **Checked (Active):** The job will execute according to its schedule.
- **Unchecked (Inactive):** The job is paused and will not run until reactivated.

Use this to temporarily disable a job without deleting it.
