# Overview of Incident Management

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained. 'Normal service operation' is defined here as service operation within service level agreement (SLA) limits.

## Definition

An incident is defined as:

*An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service*

Failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an incident – for example, failure of one disk from a mirror set.

## Scope

Incident Management includes any event which disrupts, or which could disrupt, a service. This includes events which are communicated directly by users, either through the Service Desk or through an interface from event management to incident management tools.

Incidents can also be reported and/or logged by technical staff (if, for example, they notice something untoward with a hardware or network component they may report or log an incident and refer it to the Service Desk). This does not mean that all events are incidents. Many classes of events are not related to disruptions at all, but are indicators of normal operation or are simply informational.

## Process Activities, Methods, and Techniques

### Incident Detection and Recording

- Incidents can be detected and logged through various sources:
  - User calls to the Service Desk
  - Automated monitoring tools
  - Technical staff observations
  - Event management tools

### Incident Classification and Initial Support

- Categorize the incident
- Determine the priority based on Impact and Urgency
- Provide initial support and attempt resolution
- If immediate resolution isn't possible, escalate appropriately

### Investigation and Diagnosis

- Determine exactly what has gone wrong or being sought by the user
- Understand the chronology of events
- Discover the full symptoms
- Determine the circumstances in which the incident occurs

### Resolution and Recovery

- Once a potential resolution has been identified, this should be applied and tested
- Recovery actions should be taken to restore service
- Resolution should be documented

### Incident Closure

- Check that the incident is fully resolved
- Check user satisfaction with the resolution
- Update incident record with relevant closure information
- Close the incident
- Conduct incident categorization checks

## Key Performance Indicators

- Mean time to restore service (MTRS)
- Number and percentage of incidents resolved remotely, without the need for a visit
- Number and percentage of incidents resolved by the Service Desk
- Average incident cost
- Percentage of incidents handled within agreed response time
- Average time to respond to incidents (by priority)
- Average time to resolve incidents (by priority)
- Percentage of incidents closed by the Service Desk without reference to other levels of support
- Number and percentage of incidents resolved per Service Desk agent
- Total numbers of incidents (as a control measure)
- Size of current incident backlog
