# Logs Tab

The Logs tab provides a real-time, detailed trace of the scan's progress and actions taken by the discovery engine on the targeted host(s). It's especially helpful for troubleshooting, validation, and understanding scan behavior.

Details include:

- <span class="Strong">Host type discovery</span>  
  Lines like:

  - 192.168.40.83 is of type Windows → OS fingerprinting succeeded.

  - … is of type UnknownHost → the probe couldn’t fingerprint the OS (often due to closed ports or blocked protocols).

- <span class="Strong">Sensor invocation</span>  
  Examples (you’ll see many of these):

  - Going to invoke sensor Windows WMIC System Info …

  - … Windows Installed Software …

  - … Certificate Check …  
    These show which <span class="Strong">sensor</span> ran for that IP and phase (WMIC/WMI, SSH, SNMP, disk, process, certificate, etc.).

- <span class="Strong">Responses / outcomes</span>

  - … to process response or Scan completed indicates a successful sensor pass.

  - Timeouts, auth failures, or connection errors will be printed here useful for troubleshooting credentials, firewalls, or network reachability.

- Verification: The Logs tab confirms that all scan modules — such as software inventory, running processes, and application dependencies — ran successfully.

  - Shows each scan request

  - Confirms execution

  - Highlights errors

  - Sensor processing confirmation
