# Incident State Workflow

Use this function to create automated workflows that define how incidents progress through their lifecycle stages.

By associating an incident workflow with an incident, the process is quicker and eliminates the need for manual stage/state changes by users with relevant access. Once an incident workflow is associated with an incident, the stage/state transitions happen automatically based on defined conditions, and relevant roles are notified.

In the main window, click **Admin > Incident Management > Incident State Workflow**. The Incident State Workflow window displays.
