- [ ] Access permissions verified
- [ ] Backup completed
- [ ] Monitoring tools configured

- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Users informed of potential impact
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Escalation contacts identified
- [ ] Communication channels established

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 3: Implementation

**Actions:**
1. Update change status to "Implementing"
2. Follow implementation plan step-by-step
3. Document each action taken
4. Monitor system behavior
5. Record any deviations
6. Maintain communication log

**Best Practices:**
- Execute one step at a time
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Document everything
- Maintain continuous communication
- Monitor key metrics throughout

### Phase 4: Verification

**Actions:**
1. Execute verification tests
2. Compare against success criteria
3. Validate functionality
4. Check dependent systems
5. Review error logs
6. Confirm expected behavior

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests pass successfully
- No critical errors detected
- Performance within acceptable range
- Dependent systems functioning
- Users can access resources

### Phase 5: Post-Implementation

**Actions:**
1. Update change status to "Review"
2. Document final state
3. Capture metrics
4. Brief support team
5. Monitor for issues
6. Gather feedback

**Monitoring Period:**
- Critical changes: 24-48 hours
- Major changes: 12-24 hours
- Minor changes: 4-8 hours

## Implementation Status Tracking

### Status Updates

Update change status regularly:

**Before Implementation**
- **Scheduled**: Change is scheduled
- **Preparing**: Pre-implementation activities underway

**During Implementation**
- **Implementing**: Change in progress
- **On Hold**: Temporary pause
- **Backing Out**: Rolling back change

**After Implementation**
- **Review**: Verification in progress
- **Completed**: Successfully implemented
- **Failed**: Implementation unsuccessful
- **Rolled Back**: Change reversed

### Progress Updates

Provide regular progress updates:

1. Open the change request
2. Navigate to **Comments** tab
3. Add progress update:
   - Current status
   - Activities completed
   - Next steps
   - Any issues encountered
4. Update estimated completion time if needed

## Managing Implementation Issues

### Issue Identification

Monitor for:
- Error messages
- Performance degradation
- Functionality failures
- Unexpected behavior
- User complaints

### Issue Response

When issues detected:

**Severity Assessment**
1. Determine issue severity
2. Assess business impact
3. Evaluate options:
   - Continue with fix
   - Pause for troubleshooting
   - Execute backout plan

**Decision Criteria**

**Continue if:**
- Issue is minor and known
- Fix is available and quick
- Business impact minimal
- Within risk tolerance

**Pause if:**
- Issue is unexpected
- Root cause unclear
- Fix time uncertain
- Need to reassess approach

**Backout if:**
- Critical functionality impaired
- Business impact severe
- Cannot resolve quickly
- Risk exceeds benefit

## Backout Procedures

### When to Execute Backout

Trigger backout plan if:
- Implementation fails
- Critical issues arise
- Success criteria not met
- Business requests rollback
- Time window expiring

### Backout Process

1. **Decision**: Determine backout necessary
2. **Notification**: Alert all stakeholders
3. **Execution**: Follow documented backout plan
4. **Verification**: Confirm system restored
5. **Documentation**: Record all actions
6. **Review**: Analyze what went wrong

### Post-Backout Actions

After successful backout:
- Update change status to "Rolled Back"
- Document lessons learned
- Revise implementation plan
- Schedule new implementation
- Conduct post-mortem review

## Communication During Implementation

### Status Updates

**Frequency:**
- Every 30 minutes for critical changes
- Hourly for major changes
- At key milestones for minor changes

**Communication Channels:**
- Change record comments
- Email to stakeholders
- Instant messaging for team
- Dashboard status updates

### Stakeholder Communication
