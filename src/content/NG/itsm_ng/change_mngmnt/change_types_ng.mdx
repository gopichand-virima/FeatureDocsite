# Change Types

Virima Change Management supports three primary types of changes, each with different processes and approval requirements.

## Standard Changes

Standard changes are pre-authorized, low-risk changes that follow a documented procedure.

### Characteristics
- Pre-approved by Change Advisory Board (CAB)
- Low risk and well understood
- Documented procedure exists
- Minimal business impact
- Can be implemented without CAB approval

### Examples
- Password resets
- Standard software installations
- Routine hardware replacements
- Regular system maintenance
- Adding new user accounts

### Process Flow
1. Submit standard change request
2. Automatic approval (pre-authorized)
3. Schedule implementation
4. Execute change
5. Close change record

### Benefits
- Faster implementation
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Consistent execution
- Lower risk of errors

## Normal Changes

Normal changes require evaluation, approval, and scheduling through the standard change management process.

### Characteristics
- Requires CAB review and approval
- Moderate to high risk
- Potential business impact
- May affect multiple systems or users
- Needs detailed planning

### Examples
- Server upgrades
- Application deployments
- Network infrastructure changes
- System migrations
- Major configuration changes

### Process Flow
1. Submit change request
2. Initial review
3. Impact assessment
4. CAB review and approval
5. Schedule implementation
6. Implement change
7. Post-implementation review
8. Close change record

### Required Documentation
- Detailed implementation plan
- Backout plan
- Risk assessment
- Impact analysis
- Resource requirements
- Testing plan

## Emergency Changes

Emergency changes address critical issues that require immediate resolution to prevent or resolve major incidents.

### Characteristics
- Urgent and time-sensitive
- Addresses critical business impact
- Expedited approval process
- May be implemented before full approval
- Requires emergency CAB (ECAB) review

### Examples
- Security vulnerability patches
- System outage resolution
- Critical bug fixes
- Recovery from major incidents
- Urgent compliance requirements

### Process Flow
1. Identify emergency situation
2. Expedited approval from ECAB
3. Immediate implementation
4. Document changes made
5. Post-implementation CAB review
6. Update procedures if needed
7. Close change record

### Emergency CAB (ECAB)
- Smaller group than regular CAB
- Available for rapid response
- Authority to approve emergency changes
- Reviews all emergency changes after implementation

## Change Type Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Standard Change
- Change is routine and repeatable
- Procedure is well documented
- Risk is low and understood
- Pre-authorization exists

### When to Use Normal Change
- Change affects critical systems
- Multiple stakeholders involved
- Significant business impact possible
- No standard procedure exists

### When to Use Emergency Change
- Critical business function impaired
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Major incident in progress
- Regulatory compliance at risk

## Change Type Configuration

Administrators can configure change types:

### Define Standard Changes
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Change Management**
2. Select **Standard Changes**
3. Click **New Standard Change**
4. Define:
   - Name and description
   - Procedure documentation
   - Authorized implementers
   - Required approvals
   - Implementation schedule

### Set Approval Workflows
Configure different approval paths for each change type:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Workflows**
2. Select **Change Management Workflows**
3. Configure approval stages for each type
4. Define escalation rules
5. Set time limits for approvals

## Change Type Metrics

Track performance by change type:

### Key Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful changes by type
- **Average Duration**: Time from submission to closure
- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage requiring backout
- **Approval Time**: Average time in approval stage

### Reporting
Generate reports to analyze change type effectiveness:
1. Navigate to **Reports** > **Change Management**
2. Select **Change Type Analysis**
3. Choose date range
4. Review metrics by type

## Best Practices

### Standard Changes
- Keep procedures up to date
- Regular review of standard change catalog
- Audit standard change implementations
- Retire unused standard changes

### Normal Changes
- Ensure thorough impact assessment
- Involve all stakeholders early
- Schedule during maintenance windows
- Conduct post-implementation reviews

### Emergency Changes
- Minimize use of emergency classification
- Document all actions taken
- Review to prevent recurrence
- Update standard procedures based on learnings
