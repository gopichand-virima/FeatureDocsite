# SLA Management

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the expected response and resolution times for incidents based on priority and other factors.

## SLA Overview

### What is an SLA?

A Service Level Agreement is a commitment to:
- Respond to incidents within a specified time
- Resolve incidents within a target timeframe
- Provide regular updates
- Maintain quality standards

### SLA Components

**Response Time:**
Time from incident creation to first response
- Acknowledgment of receipt
- Initial triage
- Assignment to technician

**Resolution Time:**
Time from incident creation to resolution
- Troubleshooting
- Implementing solution
- User confirmation

**Update Interval:**
Frequency of communication
- Progress updates
- Status changes
- User notifications

## Standard SLA Targets

### By Priority

| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time | Update Frequency |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| P1 - Critical | 15 minutes | 4 hours | Every 30 minutes |
| P2 - High | 1 hour | 8 hours | Every 2 hours |
| P3 - Medium | 4 hours | 24 hours | Daily |
| P4 - Low | 8 hours | 72 hours | As needed |

### Business Hours vs 24/7

**Business Hours:**
- Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 6 PM
- Excludes holidays
- SLA clock runs only during business hours

**24/7 Coverage:**
- All hours, all days
- Continuous clock
- Used for critical systems

**Configuration:**
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **SLA Management**
2. Define business hours
3. Assign to SLA definitions
4. System calculates automatically

## SLA Clock

### When SLA Starts

SLA clock begins when:
- Incident is created
- Status is "New"
- Timestamp recorded

### When SLA Pauses

Clock may pause during:
- **On Hold Status**: Waiting for external input
- **After Hours**: If business hours SLA
- **Holidays**: Organizational holidays
- **User Delay**: Awaiting user response

**Configuration:**
Administrators configure pause conditions:
1. **Admin** > **SLA** > **Pause Rules**
2. Define pause triggers
3. Set resume conditions

### When SLA Stops

Clock stops when:
- Incident resolved
- Status changes to Resolved
- Does NOT stop at Closed
- Resolution time captured

### When SLA Resumes

Clock resumes when:
- On Hold removed
- Business hours resume
- User response received
- External dependency cleared

## SLA Calculation

### Response SLA

**Start:** Incident created
**Stop:** First substantive response

**What Counts as Response:**
- Technician assigned incident
- Initial contact with user
- First work note added
- Status changed to In Progress

**What Doesn't Count:**
- Auto-acknowledgment emails
- Assignment notifications
- System-generated messages

### Resolution SLA

**Start:** Incident created
**Stop:** Status changed to Resolved

**Includes:**
- All troubleshooting time
- Implementation time
- Testing time
- Communication time

**Excludes:**
- Time On Hold (configurable)
- After-hours time (if business hours SLA)
- Time waiting for user confirmation after Resolved

## Monitoring SLA

### SLA Indicators

**In Incident List:**
Color-coded indicators:
- 🟢 **Green**: On track (>25% time remaining)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: At risk (<25% time remaining)
- 🔴 **Red**: Breached (past target time)

**Time Display:**
- Shows time remaining
- Or time since breach
- Updates in real-time

### SLA Dashboard

Monitor overall SLA performance:

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** > **SLA Dashboard**
2. View widgets:
   - **SLA Compliance Rate**: % meeting SLA
   - **At-Risk Incidents**: About to breach
   - **Breached Incidents**: Past SLA
   - **Average Response Time**: Actual response times
   - **Average Resolution Time**: Actual resolution times

### SLA Alerts

Automatic notifications:

**Warning Alerts (75% of SLA):**
- To: Assigned technician
- Message: SLA at risk
- Action: Prioritize or escalate

**Critical Alerts (90% of SLA):**
- To: Technician + Manager
- Message: Imminent SLA breach
- Action: Immediate attention needed

**Breach Alerts (100% + of SLA):**
- To: Technician + Manager + Director
- Message: SLA breached
- Action: Escalate and expedite

## Managing SLA Breaches

### When Breach Occurs

Immediate actions:

1. **Notification Sent:**
   - Assigned technician
   - Manager
   - Incident flagged

2. **Required Actions:**
   - Document reason for breach
   - Escalate if necessary
   - Expedite resolution
   - Increase update frequency

3. **Communication:**
   - Notify requester
   - Provide ETA
   - Explain situation
   - Set new expectations

### Breach Documentation

Document all breaches:

**Required Information:**
- Root cause of breach
- Contributing factors
- Actions taken
- Prevention measures

**How to Document:**
1. Open breached incident
2. Navigate to **SLA** tab
3. Click **Document Breach**
4. Complete breach report
5. Submit for review

### Breach Analysis

Regular breach review:

**Weekly Review:**
- All breached incidents
- Common causes
- Trend analysis
- Corrective actions

**Monthly Metrics:**
- Breach rate by priority
- Breach rate by category
- Breach rate by team
- Improvement trends

## SLA Exceptions

### Requesting Exception

For unusual circumstances:

1. Open the incident
2. Click **Request SLA Exception**
3. Provide justification:
   - Why exception needed
   - What caused delay
   - Business impact
4. Submit for approval

### Valid Exception Reasons

- Force majeure events
- Vendor outage
- Widespread outage (multiple incidents)
- Insufficient information from user
- Change freeze period
- Critical resource unavailable

### Exception Approval

**Approval Authority:**
- Incident Manager: P3, P4 exceptions
- IT Director: P2 exceptions
- CIO: P1 exceptions

**Process:**
1. Exception requested
