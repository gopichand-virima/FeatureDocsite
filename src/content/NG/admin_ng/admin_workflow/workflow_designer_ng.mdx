### Add Conditions

Define conditions that must be met for workflow to execute.

Drag a **Condition** node onto the canvas.

Connect it to the trigger node.

**Condition Builder**:

Build conditions using:

**Field Comparisons**:

- Priority = Critical
- Category is "Hardware"
- Status changed from "New" to "Assigned"
- Assignee is not empty
- Created date is within last 7 days

**User/Group Checks**:

- Requester is VIP
- Assignment group is "Network Team"
- Assignee has specific role
- User is in specific department

**Related Record Checks**:

- Has related incidents
- Parent change approved
- Linked CI is in production
- Has open child tickets

**Time-Based Conditions**:

- During business hours
- Outside business hours
- On weekends
- During specific date range

**Custom Conditions**:

- JavaScript expression
- Formula field
- Script evaluation

Use **AND** / **OR** logic to combine conditions.

Click **Save** on the condition node.

### Add Actions

### Branching and Decision Logic

Create conditional branches in your workflow.

Drag a **Decision** node onto the canvas.

Configure multiple paths based on conditions:

**If-Then-Else Logic**:

```
IF Priority is Critical
  THEN notify executive team
  ELSE notify normal support
```

**Switch/Case Logic**:

```
SWITCH Category
  CASE "Hardware": assign to hardware team
