# About Financial Management

Financial Management enables organizations to plan, track, and manage the costs associated with their Configuration Items (CIs) and Services. It provides a structured way to define financial plans, record recurring expenses, monitor cost processing intervals, and maintain complete visibility into the financial lifecycle of IT assets and services.

In the navigation pane, select **ITAM** > **Financial Management**. The menu expands and displays the following options:

- [Service Financial Plan](/itam/financial_management/service_financial_plan_6_1.mdx)
- [CI Financial Plan](/itam/financial_management/ci_financial_plan_6_1.mdx)
