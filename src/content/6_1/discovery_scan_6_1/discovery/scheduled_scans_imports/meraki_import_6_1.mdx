3.  Fill the header:

    - <span class="Strong">Credential</span>/*: pick your Meraki API credential.

    - <span class="Strong">Timezone</span>: choose the correct region.

    - <span class="Strong">Import Frequency</span>: leave <span class="Strong">Current Time Settings</span> and set the wheels below, or change it and still use the wheels.

    - Toggle <span class="Strong">Active</span> (must be ON to execute a scan) and <span class="Strong">Recurring</span> if you want it to repeat.

    - <span class="Strong">Note:</span> Meraki has no per-service checkboxes—your credential controls what’s pulled (orgs/networks/devices the key can see).

4.  Use the time wheels (<span class="Strong">Second / Minute / Hour / Day / Month / Weekday</span>) to schedule.

# Additional notes on Excel import behavior

When importing scan records using an Excel sheet, the following conditions and behaviors apply:

- <span class="Strong">Past timestamps are ignored</span>

  - If the timestamp specified in the Excel sheet is a past date/time, that record will <span class="Strong">not be imported</span>. The system will <span class="Strong">skip</span> the record to avoid scheduling outdated scans.

- <span class="Strong">Active status handling</span>

  - If the Active status in the Excel sheet is set to true, the record will be stored and a scan shall be triggered at the scheduled time

  - If the Active status is set to false or left <span class="Strong">blank</span>, the record will be stored but a scan will not be triggered

- <span class="Strong">Recurring flag behavior</span>

  - If the Recurring field is set to true, the system treats it as a <span class="Strong">recurring scan scheduled every year</span>, and the value is stored in the DB as /*.

  - If the Recurring field is set to false or left <span class="Strong">blank</span>, the scan is treated as <span class="Strong">current year only</span>.

- <span class="Strong">Client status requirement</span>

  - The scan record will only be imported if the associated <span class="Strong">client is active</span>. If the client is <span class="Strong">inactive</span> or not properly configured, the system will <span class="Strong">not import</span> the record.

- <span class="Strong">Time component validation</span>

  - If the minute field is set to /*, the system will <span class="Strong">not import</span> the record.

  - If the day field is set to /*, it will be interpreted as <span class="Strong">every day</span>.

  - If the hour field is set to /*, it will be interpreted as <span class="Strong">every hour</span>.

  - If the month field is set to /*, it will be interpreted as <span class="Strong">every month</span>.

  - If the weekdays field is set to /*, it will be interpreted as <span class="Strong">every week</span>.

You can use either the month or weekdays field — <span class="Strong">not both</span> simultaneously.

- <span class="Strong">Only numeric values</span> are accepted in the month and weekdays fields. <span class="Strong">Alphabetic representations (e.g., "Jan", "Mon") are not allowed</span> and will result in import failure.

1.  <span class="Strong">Cron Expression (human-readable)</span>

    - This line summarizes the schedule you build with the wheels below (e.g., <span class="Emphasis">“at 2, 5 and 6 minutes at 0, 2, 3, 6 and 7 hours”</span>).

    - Treat it as a <span class="Strong">preview</span>: changing the wheels updates this text. Use it to sanity-check your schedule.
