## Go to Page

If applicable, enter a page number, and press **Enter**. If that page exists, the page information is displayed.


This is only applicable if the total number of items on the page exceeds the page display setting. For example, if the page can display 10 line items, and only 5 line items exist, the "Go To Page "option is not shown.
