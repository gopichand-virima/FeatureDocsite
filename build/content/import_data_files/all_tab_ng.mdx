# **All Tab**

- Displays every record included in the imported file, regardless of whether it matches an existing CI or is a new CI.
  - **Blueprint Name**: Name of the Blueprint
  - **CI**: CMDB CI ID matching the imported CI
  - **Asset Name**: The name of the asset as recognized in the import file or system.
  - **Asset ID**: New Asset ID is created with prefix of "IMP" to denote that this record was imported. The format is "IMP" + 6 digits (auto generated sequential number).
- Clicking the hyperlinked CI ID under CI column will display the corresponding record in CMDB.

- If we click on any other column values regardless of whether CI exists in CMDB or not, the user is redirected to Imported Assets view to view the imported asset data.
