# Departments

Use this function to categorize users, groups, and assets.

- In the main window, click **Admin > Organizational Details > Departments**. The Departments window displays.


### Add Department

- From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose an action: **New Department**, [Delete](/common_topics/delete_remove_6_1.mdx) or [Export](/discovery/import_data_files/export_6_1.mdx). The New Departments window displays.

- Enter the *Name*, *Description*, and *Email* of the department.
- When all entries are made, click **Add**.


### Add Members

### Edit Department

Not all functions include an option to edit record line items shown in the main window.


- Navigate to the window containing the record to edit.
- Click the line containing the record. The applicable window or dialog box displays.
- Make the necessary modifications.

When editing an existing item, other options may be available, such as adding [Tasks](/itsm/release_mngmt/tasks_6_1.mdx), [Comments](/discovery/comments_6_1.mdx), and [Attachments](/discovery/attachments_6_1.mdx) and viewing [History](/common_topics/history_6_1.mdx).


The options change based upon the function; therefore, not every option may be shown.
