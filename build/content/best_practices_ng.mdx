# Best Practices

# **Schedule During Off-Peak Hours**

Run scans and imports overnight or on weekends to minimize network load and avoid disrupting business operations.

# **Use Descriptive Names**

Name your scheduled jobs clearly (e.g., "Nightly Production Network Scan" or "Weekly AWS Import").

# **Monitor Logs Regularly**

Review execution logs to identify and resolve credential issues, connectivity problems, or failed jobs.

# **Keep Credentials Updated**

Ensure that credentials used by scheduled jobs remain valid and have appropriate permissions.

# **Test Before Scheduling**

Always run a scan or import manually (on-demand) before scheduling it to verify that the configuration is correct.

# **Align Frequency with Business Needs**

Adjust scan/import frequency based on change rates in your environment. High-change environments may require daily scans, while stable environments may need only weekly updates.
