# Components

The ****Components** tab** displays all sub-elements associated with the selected Configuration Item (CI). These components represent the software, hardware, and runtime entities that make up or run on the CI.

The available component categories include:

- Hard drives
- Installed software
- Listening processes
- Network adapters
- Network storage disks
- Peripheral devices
- Processes
- Services
- Software instances
- Storage disks
- Windows updates
- MMC certificates
- IP connections

**Note**: The components displayed here are based on the blueprint assigned to the CI. For example, the components in the screenshot reflect a Windows Host blueprint.

Each blueprint type (e.g., Windows Server, Linux Server, Software Application) will have its own set of relevant components.
