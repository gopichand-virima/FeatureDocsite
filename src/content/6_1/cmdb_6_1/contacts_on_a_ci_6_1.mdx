# Contacts on a CI

Use these cards to record who owns and supports the CI. Each card shows a profile avatar, <span class="Strong">Name</span>, <span class="Strong">Email</span>, and <span class="Strong">Phone</span>.  
Common controls:

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> (pencil) — opens a picker to select a user or type details.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span> (×) — clears the current assignment.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Collapse</span> (–) — hides/shows the card body.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Validation</span>

- Email must be a valid format (e.g., name@domain.com).

- Phone must follow standard numbering (digits, +, spaces, dashes).

- When selecting from the directory, only active users can be assigned.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Owner</span>

The system assigns the logged-in user as the CI owner when adding or moving a CI record from Discovered Items to CMDB.

If the discovery process provides a user list and that user exists in the Admin → User Management directory, Virima assigns that user as the CI Owner instead of the logged-in user.

After the CI is in the CMDB, you can manually update the Owner field at any time by editing the CI record.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span> – Owner’s full name (can be chosen from the user directory).

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Email / Phone</span> – Auto-filled from the user record; can be edited if needed.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span> – Unassigns the owner; the CI will have no owner until one is set.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">First-Level Support </span><span class="Strong_1">(if enabled in your environment)</span>

The help desk or primary support group for end-user issues.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Name / Email / Phone</span> – Primary contact for initial triage and ticket intake.

- Use <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> to assign a person or shared mailbox/account.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Second Level Support</span>

The technical team that handles escalations from first level.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Name / Email / Phone</span> – Escalation contact(s) for deeper investigation.

- Assign an individual or the lead for a support group.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Third Level Support</span>

Specialist/vendor team for complex or product-specific issues.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Name / Email / Phone</span> – Expert contact or vendor support liaison.

- Use for OEM, platform, or engineering escalations.

When a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is triggered for a Configuration Item (CI) in the Virima CMDB, the system automatically assigns the First-Level, Second-Level, and Third-Level Support contacts to the CI. These assignments are based on the support contacts defined in the CI’s profile

# Manager

The line manager for the CI Owner or support team.

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Name / Email / Phone</span> – Used for escalations that require managerial action.

- Often auto-suggested when you pick an Owner (pulls org data if available).
