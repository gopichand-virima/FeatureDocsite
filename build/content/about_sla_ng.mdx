# About SLA Management

The SLA (Service Level Agreement) Management module provides comprehensive tools for defining, tracking, and managing service level commitments. This section covers the administrative configuration options available for SLA management.

SLA Management in Virima enables organizations to:

- Define service level commitments with clear targets
- Track performance against SLA targets in real-time
- Automate SLA calculations based on business hours
- Escalate tickets approaching SLA breach
- Generate SLA compliance reports
- Maintain multiple SLAs for different service tiers
- Configure SLA pause conditions
- Define SLA milestones and response times

## Key Configuration Areas

The following administrative functions are available for SLA Management:

- **SLA Definitions**: Create and manage SLA agreements
- **SLA Metrics**: Define response and resolution targets
- **SLA Calendars**: Associate business hours with SLAs
- **SLA Escalations**: Configure breach notifications
- **SLA Pause Conditions**: Define when SLA timers pause
- **SLA Reporting**: Configure compliance tracking
- **Multi-Tier SLAs**: Support different service levels

Each of these areas can be configured to match your organization's specific service level commitments and operational requirements.

## SLA vs OLA vs UC

Understanding the distinctions:

- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Commitments to customers/end users
- **OLA (Operational Level Agreement)**: Internal team commitments
- **UC (Underpinning Contract)**: Third-party vendor commitments

All three can be tracked and managed within Virima's SLA module.
