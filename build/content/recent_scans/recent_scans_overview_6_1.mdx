# Overview

The **Recent Scans** function provides IT teams with a centralized view of discovery scan activities across the infrastructure. It displays real-time and historical scan data, including status, duration, runtime, and completion details, through an easy-to-use dashboard. By offering transparency and traceability, this feature helps administrators monitor discovery processes, troubleshoot failures, and verify successful asset detection.

Recent Scans enables teams to quickly identify which scans are running, review completed scan results, and access detailed logs for any scan operation. This visibility is crucial for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and ensuring comprehensive network coverage.
