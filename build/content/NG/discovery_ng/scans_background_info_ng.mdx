# Background Information on Scans

There are three components related to scanning:

- Probes executes a set of scripts on the target hosts to retrieve information. Each host type will have a different probe.
- **Probe Workflows** executes a script when a scan is created. The workflow calls the set of the probes required to discover the information about the hosts on which the scan is performed.
- Sensors. Scripts that are applied to the output of the respective probes. The sensors give the data JSON output.

The basic work flow is as follows:

- Find up and running Hosts.
- Get Host Types for each host.
- If Host Type is **Unix**, find the Unix OS flavor and, depending on the OS, send the probes to the Discovery Server, which retrieves the information of the host.
- If Host Type is Windows or **Network device**, send probes to the the Discovery Server that retrieves the information of the host.

For discovering Windows machines in a workgroup, the admin shared folder should be remotely accessible. Enable this folder by following these steps:

Run **regedit**.

Navigate to this directory : HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System

Right-click on the right pane and choose New > DWORD ** (32-bit) Value**.

Fill LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy for the Value name and press **Enter**.

Double-click LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy value and modify the "Value Data" from "0" to "1".

Click OK .

To verify whether the admin share is accessible, run the following on the command line:

net use \\remoteIP\admin$ /user: \* Example: net use \\111.222.333.444\admin$ /user:win7-2\admin \*
