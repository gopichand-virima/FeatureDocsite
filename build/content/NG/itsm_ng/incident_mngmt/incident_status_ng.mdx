# Incident Status

Incident status indicates the current state of an incident in its lifecycle from creation through resolution and closure.

## Status Lifecycle

Incidents progress through the following statuses:

```
New → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
                        ↓
                    On Hold
                        ↓
                  Cancelled
```

- Bottlenecks (long status durations)
- Status distribution
- Workflow efficiency

**Access Reports:**
1. Navigate to **Reports** > **Incident Management**
2. Select **Status Analysis**
3. View time-in-status metrics

### Status-Based SLAs

Different SLA rules by status:

**SLA Timing:**

3. Set pause/resume conditions

## Best Practices

### Keep Status Current

**Update Promptly:**
- Change status immediately when state changes
- Don't leave incidents in wrong status
- Accurate status = accurate metrics
- Users rely on status for updates

### Use On Hold Appropriately

**Do Use On Hold:**
- Genuinely waiting for something
- External dependency
- User unavailable
- Parts on order

**Don't Use On Hold:**
- Just busy with other work
- Forgot about incident
- Avoiding SLA breach
- Don't know how to fix

### Document Status Changes

**Always Add Notes:**

- Expected timeline

**Example Work Note:**
```
Status changed to On Hold.
Reason: Awaiting replacement part from vendor.
Expected delivery: Nov 30, 2024
Will resume troubleshooting upon arrival.
```

### Resolve vs. Close

**Use Resolved:**
- Solution implemented
- Need user confirmation
- Want feedback period
- Allow time for verification

**Use Closed:**
- User confirmed fix
- Auto-close period elapsed
- Verified working
- No further action needed

## Reopening Incidents

### When to Reopen

Reopen if:
- Original issue returned
- Solution didn't work
- New information available
- Related to same root cause

2. Click **Reopen** button
3. Add reason for reopening
4. Status returns to In Progress
5. SLA clock restarts

### Reopen Best Practices

- Document why reopening
- Check if new incident more appropriate
- Link to related incidents
- Analyze why initial resolution failed

## Status Reports

### Standard Status Reports
