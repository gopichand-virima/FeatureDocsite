# Probes

A probe is a complete set of commands executed on the remote host to gather the required details based on the Probe Workflow. In Virima, there are different types of probes to execute on different types of hosts--for example, Nmap probe, Linux system probe, Windows OS probe, etc.

Use this function to execute a complete set of commands on a remote host to fetch the probe workflow.

In the main window, click **Admin**>Discovery** > Probes**. The Probes window displays.
