| <span class="Strong">Unknown Hosts</span>    | The targets are reachable, but none of the supplied credentials authenticated, so the OS couldn’t be identified. | Typical causes: missing/invalid credentials, blocked ports, partial responses.                                            |
| <span class="Strong">Unknown Devices</span>  | Devices discovered but not fully classified (often due to missing credentials/ports).                            | Insufficient SNMP/SSH/WMI data or atypical fingerprints.                                                                  |

# How to view the report

- Use filters/pivots to roll up by <span class="Strong">Client</span>, <span class="Strong">Probe</span>, or <span class="Strong">Scan Range</span>.

- High <span class="Strong">Unknown/Down</span> counts usually point to credential or connectivity gaps (check WMI/SSH/SNMP access, firewalls, and routing).

- Remember the <span class="Strong">Start Time</span> reflects the <span class="Strong">schedule’s timezone</span>, not your current browser time.

- If you scanned multiple entries, you’ll see <span class="Strong">one row per entry</span>—counts are per entry (not de-duplicated across rows).

# <span class="Strong">Details (default)</span>

- <span class="Strong">Name, Probe, Client, Activity</span> – who/what ran and the last action.

- <span class="Strong">IP Range</span> – targets for the run.

- <span class="Strong">Host Details</span> – quick counts (total hosts, Windows/Unix, network/unknown).

- <span class="Strong">Run By, Location, Status, Triggered At, Completed At, Scan Duration</span>.

- <span class="Strong">Results grid</span> (bottom): one line per discovered endpoint with filters for:

  - <span class="Strong">IP Address, Host Name, Result, Details, Device Type, Device Summary</span>  
    (e.g., OS, domain/workgroup, MAC).  
    Tip: use the column filters to narrow to a device quickly.

# <span class="Strong">Logs</span>

- Full execution log for the run (scrollable).

- Buttons: <span class="Strong">Download Logs</span> (saves the full text) and <span class="Strong">Refresh</span>.
