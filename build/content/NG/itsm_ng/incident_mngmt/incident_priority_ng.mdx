# Incident Priority

Priority determines the order in which incidents are addressed. Understanding priority calculation and management is crucial for effective incident resolution.

## Priority Calculation

Priority is automatically calculated based on two factors:

### Impact
The business effect of the incident:

#### High Impact
- Critical business function unavailable
- Large number of users affected (>50)
- VIP or executive user impacted
- Revenue-generating system down
- Legal or compliance risk

**Examples:**
- Email system down for entire company
- E-commerce site unavailable
- Payroll system failure
- Customer-facing application outage

#### Medium Impact
- Important function degraded
- Moderate number of users affected (10-50)
- Department-level impact
- Workaround available but inefficient

**Examples:**
- Shared printer not working
- Non-critical application slow
- File server performance issue
- Department database access problem

#### Low Impact
- Individual user affected
- Minor function impacted
- Local workstation issue
- Cosmetic or convenience issue

**Examples:**
- Single user printer problem
- Desktop shortcut missing
- Non-critical application error
- Password reset needed

### Urgency
How quickly resolution is needed:

#### High Urgency
- Work completely stopped
- Time-sensitive business process
- Deadline at risk
- Critical meeting or event dependency

**Examples:**
- Presentation system fails before board meeting
- Order processing system down during peak season
- Time-clock system failure on payday
- Security breach detected

#### Medium Urgency
- Work significantly impaired
- Workaround exists but cumbersome
- Can wait but causing inefficiency
- Normal business timeline

**Examples:**
- Software feature not working correctly
- Reports generating with errors
- Access to secondary system needed
- Network performance degraded

#### Low Urgency
- Work can continue
- Minimal disruption
- Can wait for scheduled maintenance
- Nice to have, not critical

**Examples:**
- Request for software upgrade
- Enhancement request
- Training inquiry
- Documentation update

## Priority Matrix

The system calculates priority automatically:

| Impact | Urgency | Priority | Response Target |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| High | High | P1 - Critical | 15 minutes |
| High | Medium | P2 - High | 1 hour |
| High | Low | P3 - Medium | 4 hours |
| Medium | High | P2 - High | 1 hour |
| Medium | Medium | P3 - Medium | 4 hours |
| Medium | Low | P4 - Low | 8 hours |
| Low | High | P3 - Medium | 4 hours |
| Low | Medium | P4 - Low | 8 hours |
| Low | Low | P4 - Low | 8 hours |

## Priority Adjustment

### When to Adjust Priority

Adjust priority when:
- Business context changes
- Initial assessment incorrect
- Workaround no longer viable
- Issue escalates or de-escalates
- Additional information received

### How to Adjust Priority

#### Increase Priority

1. Open the incident
2. Click **Edit**
3. Increase Impact or Urgency
4. Add work note explaining why
5. Notify relevant stakeholders
6. Save changes

**Approval Required:**
- P4 to P1: Manager approval
- P3 to P1: Manager approval
- P4/P3 to P2: Automatic

#### Decrease Priority

1. Review incident details
2. Verify lower priority appropriate
3. Update Impact or Urgency
4. Document reason in work notes
5. Notify requester
6. Save changes

**Communication Important:**
- Explain why priority lowered
- Set new expectations
- Provide reasoning
- Maintain user satisfaction

### Automatic Priority Adjustments

System may automatically adjust:

**Increase Priority When:**
- SLA breach imminent
- Multiple related incidents
- Escalation triggered
- VIP user affected

**Decrease Priority When:**
- Workaround implemented
- Impact reduced
- Affected users decrease
- Business urgency changes

## Priority Best Practices

### Setting Initial Priority

**Be Accurate:**
- Assess actual impact honestly
- Don't inflate urgency
- Consider business context
- Document reasoning

**Consider All Factors:**
- Number of users affected
- Business process impact
- Available workarounds
- Time sensitivity
- Compliance requirements

### Managing High Priority

**P1 - Critical:**
- Drop other work
- Engage immediately
- Continuous communication
- All available resources
- Management involvement

**P2 - High:**
- Prioritize appropriately
- Regular updates
- Keep management informed
- Escalate if stuck
- Monitor SLA closely

### Avoiding Priority Inflation

**Common Causes:**
- Users demanding high priority
- Lack of understanding
- Fear of low service
- Previous bad experiences

**Prevention:**
- Educate users on priority system
- Demonstrate fair treatment
- Consistent SLA adherence
- Transparent priority rules

## Priority Escalation Rules

### Automatic Escalation

System automatically escalates when:

**P1 Incidents:**
- No response in 15 minutes → Manager
- Not in progress after 30 minutes → Senior Manager
- Not resolved in 2 hours → Director

**P2 Incidents:**
- No response in 1 hour → Team Lead
- Not in progress after 2 hours → Manager
- Not resolved in 4 hours → Escalation team

**P3 Incidents:**
- No response in 4 hours → Team Lead
- SLA at 75% → Manager notification
- SLA breach → Manager involvement

### Manual Escalation

Users can request escalation:
- Click "Request Escalation" button
- Provide escalation reason
- Manager reviews and decides
- User notified of decision

## Priority Metrics

### Key Metrics by Priority

- Average resolution time by priority
- First-time fix rate
- Escalation rate
- SLA compliance percentage

**Workload Metrics:**
- Incidents by priority
- Open incidents by priority
- Aging incidents by priority
