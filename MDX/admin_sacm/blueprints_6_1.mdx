- Click **New Blueprint**.
- While viewing the New Blueprint window, complete the fields, referring to the table below.
- When all selections/entries are made, click **Add**.

### Blueprint Fields

| Field | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Name | Name given to the blueprint based on the nature of the CI. This field can be edited. |

| Is Component | When selected, the blueprint will be a component of a CI or else a Parent CI. |

| Enable Versioning | When selected, all CIs of this blueprint are versioned. *See also* [CI Versioning](/itsm/config_mngmt/config_items/config_item_details/config_items_versioning_6_1.mdx). |

| Is Integrity Check Needed | When selected, ensures the corresponding properties are present in the CI. If not, a notification is sent to the configured user. |

| Includes Blueprint | The associated blueprint properties that are included. |

| Property List | Properties listed in the blueprint, such as IP Address or Hostname. |

| Mandatory Properties | Properties specified will be mandatory fields required while adding a new CI for this blueprint. |

| Integrity Check Properties | Ensures the corresponding properties are present in the CI. If the properties are missing, a notification is sent to the configured user. |

| Main Properties | Properties included in the main property listing. |

| Private Properties | Properties added/marked as private, making them viewable according to a specified role. |

| Private Property Visibility | Roles for whom the private properties are visible. |

| Primary Property List for Correlation | The co-relator property for that blueprint. This is only for component type blueprints where Is_Components=true. |

| Related Possible Components | Components that will be part of a Parent CI. For example, a Network Adapter blueprint is a component of a Windows Server blueprint. |

| Second Level Third Level Support | User or group assigned to provide support, for example, during an escalation. |

| Blueprint icon | Icon that represents the corresponding blueprint. |

| Workflow | Business rules associated with a workflow. |

| Tags | Tag for the configured item so that it can be found when conducting a search for a CI or discovered asset in the CMDB. |

| Configure Main Page for CI | Tabs that need to be shown in the blueprint type CI. |


If this option is selected, the **Integrity Check Properties** option must be selected.


This option is required if the **Is Component** option has been selected.


### SLA

Every Blueprint has its own SLA-defined based on its business factors. When a Root Cause CI is associated with an ITSM record, then the SLA of the blueprint is taken into consideration, provided a Custom Timescale and CI SLA *are not* defined.

Use this function to configure response and resolution times for a CI marked as **Incident**, **Requests**, **Changes** or **Problems** that require resolution.

- In the main window, click a line item.
- In the Details window, click the **SLA** tab.

!

- In the *Response Time* field, specify the maximum amount of time that can pass before a response must occur.
- In the *Resolution Time* field, specify the total time allowed to find a resolution. The Resolution Time cannot be smaller than the total of all the other response times (e.g., Response Time, 1st Level Support, etc.).
- In the *Support Level* fields, specify the amount of time allowed for each support level to respond.
- In the **Escalate** section, do the following:
- For the fields in the first column, specify when an action should take place, either **Before** or **After** the specified time duration has occurred.
- For the fields in the second column, select the amount of time that can elapse before a notification is sent to the users, roles, groups and departments specified. Multiple options can be selected.
- For the actions in the third column, click **Add** (new) or **Update** (existing) to indicate who receives a notification that activity has been escalated. *Refer to* [Searching](/common_topics/searching_6_1.mdx) *for details on how to make selections in the tabs.*
- When all selections/entries are made, click **Save**.


### Edit Blueprint

Not all functions include an option to edit record line items shown in the main window.


- Navigate to the window containing the record to edit.
- Click the line containing the record. The applicable window or dialog box displays.
- Make the necessary modifications.
- Click **Save** or **Add**, as applicable.

When editing an existing item, other options may be available, such as adding [Tasks](/itsm/release_mngmt/tasks_6_1.mdx), [Comments](/discovery/comments_6_1.mdx), and [Attachments](/discovery/attachments_6_1.mdx) and viewing [History](/common_topics/history_6_1.mdx).


The options change based upon the function; therefore, not every option may be shown.
