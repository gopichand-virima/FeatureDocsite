# SSO and Authentication

The **SSO & Authentication** feature in Virima enables organizations to integrate external identity providers for secure and seamless user authentication. By connecting providers such as **Okta**, **Ping Identity**, and **Auth0**, administrators can centralize access management, enforce organizational security policies, and simplify the login experience for users. This section also allows you to add new configurations, edit existing ones, test connectivity, and manage multiple authentication methods within the platform.

# Configure SSO and Authentication

Use this procedure to configure and manage enterprise identity providers for authentication.

## Prerequisites

*   Administrator access to the Virima Platform.
    
*   Active account with your chosen identity provider (Okta, Auth0, Ping Identity, etc.).
    
*   Provider credentials such as **Application ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Issuer URL**.
    

## SSO and Auth: OIDC

1.  In the left navigation pane, under **Setup**, select **SSO and Auth**.
    
2.  Select the authentication type:
    
    *   **OIDC** for providers like Auth0, Okta, or Ping.
