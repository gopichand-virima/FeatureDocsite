# API Integration Overview

Virima provides a comprehensive RESTful API that allows you to integrate with third-party 
systems, automate workflows, and build custom applications.

## API Endpoints

The Virima API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs.

### Assets API

- `GET /api/v1/assets` - List all assets
- `POST /api/v1/assets` - Create new asset
- `GET /api/v1/assets/:id` - Get asset details
- `PUT /api/v1/assets/:id` - Update asset
- `DELETE /api/v1/assets/:id` - Delete asset

## Authentication

The Virima API uses API keys and OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Include your API key in the 
request header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://your-server/api/v1/assets
```

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format with standard HTTP status codes.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "asset-12345",
    "name": "WEB-SERVER-01",
    "type": "server",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "os": "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS",

  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-11-10T14:22:15Z",
    "version": "NG"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are limited to 1000 requests per hour per API key. Contact support for higher limits.
