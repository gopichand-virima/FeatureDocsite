# Discovered Items

The <span class="Strong">Discovered Items</span> feature in Virima provides a centralized view of assets identified during network scans before they are onboarded into the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). It displays critical details such as IP address, operating system, and hostname, allowing users to validate and manage discovered assets efficiently.

Through correlation of unique identifiers (correlators), the system determines whether to update an existing record or create a new one, ensuring data accuracy and preventing duplication. This process streamlines asset onboarding, supports compliance, and enhances IT visibility. Combined with dashboard insights, Discovered Items simplifies operational oversight and strengthens overall IT asset management.
