# Dashboard Customization

- **Add/Remove Reports:** Easily add, remove, or rearrange reports at any time.
- **Personalize Layout:** Tailor the dashboard to your needs or department.

The Virima **Dashboard** can be personalized to display a wide range of reports based on user needs and preferences. Reports can be added, removed, or rearranged at any time.

# Report Widget Controls

Each report widget includes controls in the upper-right corner:

- **Click for Complete Report:** Located in the top-right corner, this button opens a full, detailed version of the report in a new browser window.  
  (For example, clicking this on a software report will open a full Software Query Report view.)

- **Export:** Exports the report as an Excel file and emails a download link to the logged-in user.
- **Save Image:** Downloads a snapshot of the current report view.
- **Collapse/Expand:** Minimizes or restores the report’s visibility.
- **Maximize/Minimize:** Opens the report in a larger window or returns it to the dashboard.
- **Remove:** Removes the report from the dashboard (confirmation required).

**To use:**

- Click the **Auto Refresh** drop-down menu.
- Choose from:
  - None (disable auto-refresh)
