# Overview

The **Run a Scan** function enables IT administrators to initiate immediate or scheduled discovery scans across network infrastructure. This feature provides flexible, on-demand asset discovery capabilities that complement scheduled scanning operations, allowing teams to quickly discover new assets, verify changes, or respond to specific infrastructure events.

By configuring scan parameters such as IP ranges, probe types, and client selection, administrators can tailor discovery operations to specific needs—from quick host-type checks to comprehensive deep scans that capture detailed hardware, software, and configuration data. The Run a Scan interface supports various discovery scenarios including:

- **Ad-hoc discovery** of new network segments
- **Verification scans** after infrastructure changes
- **Targeted rescans** of specific devices or subnets
- **Pre-scheduled scans** for routine discovery operations

Results from scan operations appear in Recent Scans for monitoring and in Discovered Items for asset review and CMDB promotion, ensuring discovered assets are properly integrated into the overall IT asset management workflow.
