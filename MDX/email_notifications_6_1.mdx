# Email Notifications

Various functions in the application will generate an email notification when certain actions take place.

The user receives a notification based upon their email preferences as specified in their [user](/admin_users/users_6_1.mdx) account. (Admin > Users).

!

## Example Functions

The list of functions that generate an email notification is too long to list in this topic. However, below are some examples:

- When [creating a request](/itsm/request_fulfillment/requests_6_1.mdx) or [creating an incident](/itsm/incident_mngmt/incidents_6_1.mdx), an email notification is sent to Requester, Assignee, and to users based upon their email preferences.
- When adding a [new CI component](/itsm/config_mngmt/config_items/config_item_new_6_1.mdx), an email notification is sent to the applicable Roles as per the SACM RACI matrix and email preferences.
- When creating or updating a [project](/prog_proj_mngmnt/projects_6_1.mdx), an email notification is sent to Project Manager(s) associated with the project.
- When an [SLA](/cmdb_left_nav/sla_6_1.mdx) breach occurs, a notification email is sent to Change Manager(s) and CAB members.

## Example Email

The content of the email varies based upon the function. For example, when working with a project, an email may look similar to that shown below. In this email, a link can be clicked and the application will load the corresponding project detail page.
