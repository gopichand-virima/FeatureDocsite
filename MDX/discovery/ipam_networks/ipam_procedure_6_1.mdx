# IPAM Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for performing IP Address Management (IPAM) using Infoblox:

1. **Infoblox Configuration**  
  Configure Infoblox on the system to enable integration with IPAM for effective management of IP address resources.

  - Navigate to **Admin > Integration > Infoblox Configuration**.
  - Set up the necessary Infoblox credentials: username, password, and host IP address.
  - Associate the credentials with the appropriate client in the system.

2. **IPAM**  
  After configuring Infoblox, use the IPAM functionality to manage and track IP addresses, subnets, and related network details.

  - Track the total number of subnets and IP addresses in each subnet.
  - Monitor and associate IP addresses with host names, hardware, and software information.
  - Periodically re-import resource definitions and configurations from Infoblox to maintain an accurate network inventory.
