# Filter By

As the amount of data accumulates, it is often necessary to narrow it down to only specific data that is needed for a particular task. You can use filters to retrieve and display only the specific data that you need.

A filter is a set of conditions applied to a table in order to find and work with a subset of the data in that table. Users can apply, modify, create, save and delete filters.


Filters are user specific.


## Apply and Save a Filter

1. Under the column header, click in the **Filter** field.

2. Type your search text and press **Enter**. The list refreshes to show matching records.

3. Click **Save Filter**.

4. In the dialog, enter a name for the filter and click **Save**.

You can repeat these steps to create multiple saved filters.

## Apply or Delete a Saved Filter

1. Click the **Saved Filter** icon on the toolbar to open the Filters list.

2. Select a filter to apply it to your data.

3. (Optional) Click **Set as Default** to make it load automatically.

4. To remove a saved filter, click its **Delete** icon.
