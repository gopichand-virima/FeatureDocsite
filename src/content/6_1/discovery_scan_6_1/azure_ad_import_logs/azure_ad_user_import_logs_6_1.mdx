# Overview

The [Azure AD User Import Logs]{.Strong} in Virima provide a centralized view of user data imported from [Azure Active Directory (AAD)]{.Strong}. Administrators can track when imports start and finish, verify completion status, and identify issues quickly.

This feature helps ensure **data accuracy, compliance, and troubleshooting** by maintaining a clear history of all import activities. Logs can be filtered by name or date, and detailed records are available for review.
