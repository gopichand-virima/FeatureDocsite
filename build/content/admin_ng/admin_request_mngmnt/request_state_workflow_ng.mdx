# Request State Workflow

Use this function to create automated workflows that define how requests progress through their lifecycle stages.

By associating a request workflow with a service request, the process is quicker and eliminates the need for manual stage/state changes by users with relevant access. Once a request workflow is associated with a request, the stage/state transitions happen automatically based on defined conditions, and relevant roles are notified.

In the main window, click **Admin > Request Management > Request State Workflow**. The Request State Workflow window displays.
