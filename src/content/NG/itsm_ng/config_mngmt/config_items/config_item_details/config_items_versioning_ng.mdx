# CI: Versioning

The versioning of a configuration item starts from Production status and when changes are made in the CI, the version increments by 0.1.

 --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   You cannot set a version as a baseline which was versioned due to one of its components.
 --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are the conditions that versions a configuration item:

::: Bullet1
Changing one or more property values of a CI

::: Bullet1
[Adding a New Property](../../../../Admin%20-%20SACM/Add-New-Property.mdx)

::: Bullet1
Adding a [new CI Component](../Config-Item-New.mdx), for example, a Software Instance, Network Adapter, etc.

::: Bullet1
Removing a component from a CI

If the first two conditions (mentioned above) happen in any of the CI components, both the CI Component and the CI are versioned.
