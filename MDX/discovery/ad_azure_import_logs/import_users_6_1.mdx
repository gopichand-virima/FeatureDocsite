# Import Users

While importing users into Virima, the system checks if the user already exists. If not, Virima creates a new user.

For consecutive AD imports, the value of a user gets updated if the value has been modified in the AD.

After configuring AD, follow these steps:

1. Click the Import icon located to the right of the selected entry.

2. When all selections/entries are made, click **Import**.
