# Discovered Items

Use this function to view the details for a successful scan, configured items for each record, and the number of new changes discovered for the CI present in the CMDB.

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|     | The number of change can increase when the asset inside the discovered items is scanned multiple times. With every scan, new changes for that CI are found inside CMDB. Once the asset is moved into the CMDB, all the changes are applied to CI, and the asset gets deleted as a Discovered Item. |

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan /> Discovered Items**. The Discovered Items window displays.

## Filter By

To filter the list, from the *Filter By* drop-down list, select one of the following:

<div class="Bullet1">

**Show All**. Displays the Asset ID for the assets already present in the CMDB. Click the ID to open the CI record page in CMDB. An encircled number shown next to the blueprint indicates the new updates (found in the recent scan) which are not present in CMDB.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

**New**. Displays new assets (Unauthorized Assets). *Refer to* <a href="Unauthorized-Assets.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Unauthorized Assets</a>*.*

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

**Updated**. Displays existing CIs (Authorized Assets).

</div>

<table class="TableStyle-Note" style="mc-table-style: url(&#39;../Resources/TableStyles/Note.css&#39;);margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;" data-cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr class="TableStyle-Note-Body-Body1">
<td class="TableStyle-Note-BodyB-Column1-Body1"> </td>
<td class="TableStyle-Note-BodyA-Column2-Body1">For a record containing a <em>hyperlink</em> in the CI column, this asset exists in the CMDB.<br />
For a record with <em>no hyperlink</em> in the CI column, the asset has not been imported and is considered an "unauthorized asset." </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Correlation of Records

<div class="Bullet1">

The Discovery Inventory keeps only one copy of record for a particular Host. Even if the host is scanned multiple times, uniqueness in a record is maintained.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Different factors are used for correlation, which is user configurable. The Correlation logic can be edited at [Admin /> Correlation](../Admin%20-%20Discovery/Correlation.htm).

</div>
