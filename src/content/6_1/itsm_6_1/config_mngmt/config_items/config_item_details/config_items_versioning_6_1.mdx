# CI: Versioning

The versioning of a configuration item starts from Production status and when changes are made in the CI, the version increments by 0.1.

|     |                                                                                          |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     | You cannot set a version as a baseline which was versioned due to one of its components. |

Below are the conditions that versions a configuration item:

<div class="Bullet1">

Changing one or more property values of a CI

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

[Adding a New Property](../../../../Admin%20-%20SACM/Add-New-Property.htm)

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Adding a [new CI Component](../Config-Item-New.htm), for example, a Software Instance, Network Adapter, etc.

</div>

<div class="Bullet1">

Removing a component from a CI

</div>

If the first two conditions (mentioned above) happen in any of the CI components, both the CI Component and the CI are versioned.
