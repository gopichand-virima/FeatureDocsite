# Regular Scan

The **Regular Scan** section conducts a full network scan and manages the IP address ranges to include or exclude from the scan.

Fields and settings for configuring a **Regular Scan**:

- **Name:** Provide a name for the scan.
- **Probe:** Select the type of probe.
- **Client:** Select the client to scan (ensure the client is operational).
- **IP Range:** Specify the IP range to scan (e.g., **192.168.34.0/24**).
  - **Exclude IP Range:** Define specific IP ranges to exclude from the scan.
  - The maximum number of IPs allowed per scan is 1024 (Subnet /22). You can enter IPs in various formats:
  - Single or multiple IPs from different subnets: e.g., **192.168.48.1 192.168.49.2**.
  - Multiple IPs from the same subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.1,2,3,4**.
  - A range of IPs in the same subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.1-50**.
  - A single subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.0/22**.
  - Multiple subnets: e.g., **192.168.48.0/23 192.168.49.0/23**.
  - Combination of subnet and IPs: e.g., **192.168.48.0/23 192.168.48.1**.
  - The total number of IPs should not exceed 1024.
- **Location (Optional):** Specify the scan location.
- **Scan Type:** Choose between **Immediate** or **Scheduled** scan.
  - **Immediate:** The scan starts immediately.
  - **Scheduled:** The scan runs at a scheduled time.
- **Send Scan Report To (Optional):** Provide an email address for receiving scan results.

After the scan, details will appear in **Recent Scans**. Upon a successful scan, results will move to **Discovered Items** for further management.
