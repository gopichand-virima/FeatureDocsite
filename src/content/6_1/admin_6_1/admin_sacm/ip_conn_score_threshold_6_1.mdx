# IP Connection Score Threshold

The **IP Connection Score Threshold** feature helps administrators automatically manage and clean up outdated “Communicates With” relationships between assets. By setting a time-based threshold—defined in days, months, or years—the system ensures that only active and relevant communication links are retained, while stale connections are automatically removed during scans or cleanup processes.
