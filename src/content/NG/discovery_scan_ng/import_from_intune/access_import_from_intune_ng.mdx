- [Delete]{.Strong}: Remove selected import record

 - Selected import record(s) will be deleted.

 - CI(s) imported during the selected import will be removed from Discovered Items.

 - CI(s) moved to CMDB will still appear under CMDB after deleting the Intune import record.

- [Export]{.Strong} -- Download grid contents (selected or filtered rows) to Excel.

 - If you have selected rows, only the selected rows are exported.

 - If you have applied filters, all rows that match the current filters are exported.

 - If no filters are applied and no rows are selected, exporting will include all records from all pages.

 - The file includes the grid columns (e.g., **Unique ID**, **Name**, **Imported By**, **Imported On **and **Credential**) (Refer Export Excel Column Detail)

This downloads the import records NOT the CI(s).

- [Import]{.Strong} -- Initiate a new Import from Intune.
