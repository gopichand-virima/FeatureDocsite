# New

The **New** action is used to manually create a new CI entry in the CMDB.

1. Click the **Select Actions** dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

2. Choose **New** from the dropdown.

- Users can define the **CI type** (based on a blueprint) and manually fill in its properties.

- This is helpful when an asset isn't discovered automatically or needs to be added proactively.
- The form will include fields like Asset Name, Host Name, Status, Serial Number, etc., based on the selected blueprint.
- Enter the details, then click **Add**.

Great for creating standalone or exception assets not brought in through discovery or integrations.
