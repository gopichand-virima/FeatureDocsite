## Security Principles

**Principle of Least Privilege**:

Users should have only the minimum access required to perform their job functions.

**Defense in Depth**:

Multiple layers of security controls protect against threats.

**Zero Trust Architecture**:

Never trust, always verify - authenticate and authorize every access request.

**Separation of Duties**:

Critical functions require multiple people to prevent fraud and errors.
