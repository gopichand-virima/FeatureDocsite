# Change Model

Use this function to configure and populate models that can be re used for defining change requests. It can be used to define commonly occurring changes raised by Service Desk Members to skip or reduce form completion time.

Once a Change Workflow is associated to a change, the stage/state of the change is automatically made and set in the workflow, and the relevant roles are notified.
