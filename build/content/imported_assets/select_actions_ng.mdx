# **Select Actions**

The **Select Actions** dropdown provides administrators with options to perform bulk operations on one or more selected records.

# Move to CMDB

- Select one or more assets.
- From the **Select Actions** menu, choose **Move to CMDB**.
- A confirmation dialog appears:  
**"Are you sure you want to move the selected assets to CMDB?"**

- Click **Yes** to proceed.
- The selected assets are promoted to the CMDB.
- Assets that are successfully moved are removed from the **Imported Assets** page.
- A background job processes the move, so no further action is required.
- If the move fails for any reason, the asset will remain in the **Imported Assets** list.

# Delete

- Select one or more assets.
- From the **Select Actions** menu, choose **Delete**.
- A confirmation dialog appears:  
**"Are you sure you want to delete the selected assets?"**

- Confirm the deletion.
- The selected assets are permanently removed from the Imported Assets page.
- If an asset was already moved to CMDB, deleting it here will not remove the CI from CMDB.
