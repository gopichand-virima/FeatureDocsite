# Accessing Run a Scan

In the navigation pane, select **Discovery Scan > Run a Scan**. The Run a Scan window displays.

The Run a Scan page allows administrators to initiate on-demand discovery scans of network infrastructure. This interface provides flexible configuration options for scanning specific IP ranges, selecting appropriate probe types, and customizing scan parameters to meet immediate discovery needs without waiting for scheduled scans.
