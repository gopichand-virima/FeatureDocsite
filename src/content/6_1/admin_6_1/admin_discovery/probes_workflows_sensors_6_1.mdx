# Probes, Probe Workflow and Sensors

The following is some general information. These functions are not currently available in the Virima application.

## Probes

A probe is a complete set of commands executed on the remote host to gather the required details based on the Probe Workflow. In Virima, there are different types of probes to execute on different types of hosts\--for example, Nmap probe, Linux system probe, Windows OS probe, etc.

## Probe Workflow

A Probe Workflow is a sequence of steps executed while discovering a host by entering appropriate scripts.

## Sensors

Sensors are scripts that, as per probe output, put discovered information in a readable format.
