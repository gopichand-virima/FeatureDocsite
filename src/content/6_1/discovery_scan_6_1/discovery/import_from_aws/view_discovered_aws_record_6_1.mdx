# Viewing a discovered AWS record

1.  In <span class="Strong">Import from AWS</span>, open the <span class="Strong">All</span> tab and <span class="Strong">click any row</span> (e.g., an Asset Name).

2.  The <span class="Strong">Discovered Item</span> view for that asset opens.

<span class="Strong">Primary Details (left panel)</span>  
Quick facts about the CI:

- <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span> – Virima’s unique identifier for the discovered CI (e.g., DSC69303). Use this to search or reference the record.

- <span class="Strong">Blueprint</span> – The discovery blueprint that matched the resource (e.g., <span class="Strong">AWS FARGATE</span>, <span class="Strong">ECS</span>, <span class="Strong">EC2</span>). It indicates the CI’s class/type.

- <span class="Strong">Created On</span> – Timestamp when the CI was first created in the CMDB from discovery.

- <span class="Strong">Last Modified On</span> – The most recent time the CI’s data was updated (any field change or enrichment).

- <span class="Strong">Last Seen On</span><span class="inline-comment-marker"> – The last successful discovery of assets. If this gets old, the asset may be offline or unreachable.</span>

  - The "Last Seen On" field is not available for assets imported from Cloud sources.

- <span class="Strong">IP Address</span> – Last known IP detected for the CI (blank for types that don’t expose an IP).

- <span class="Strong">Host Name</span> – Host/endpoint name captured by discovery (for cloud services, often the workload/task name).

- <span class="Strong">Authorization status</span> – A badge indicating <span class="Strong">Authorized</span> or <span class="Strong">This CI is unauthorized</span>:

  - <span class="Emphasis">Authorized</span> = t<span class="inline-comment-marker">he CI is recognized/approved to exist in the CMDB; </span>surfaced from Authorize tab of Import from AWS import records view.

    - An authorized asset always has an associated CMDB ID, such as "<span class="Strong">Update to /<CMDB Asset ID/></span>".

  - <span class="Emphasis">Unauthorized</span> = the CI is new or not yet approved; typically surfaced from the <span class="Emphasis">Unauthorized</span> tab in import views.

- <span class="Strong">Tags</span><span class="inline-comment-marker"> – If any </span>  
  <span class="inline-comment-marker">Tags are AWS metadata key-value pairs attached to resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.).</span>

# <span class="Strong">Top-right actions</span>

- <span class="Strong">Move to CMDB</span> – Promotes this discovered item into the CMDB.

- <span class="Strong">Rescan Now</span> – Runs a targeted re-discovery for this single asset.

# <span class="Strong">Tabs (main panel)</span>

<span class="Strong">Details: </span>A complete inventory of the Configuration Item (CI) is captured, with the specific details shown depending on the blueprint associated with the asset.
