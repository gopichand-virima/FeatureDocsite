# Mark as Knowledge

Publish the current CI as a knowledge entry so it can be referenced in Knowledge Management. The CI stays in CMDB; this action creates/updates a linked knowledge record.

1.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions, </span>and then select<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;"> Mark As Knowledge</span>.

    <span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/CMDB%20-%20Left-Nav/Configuration%20Management%20Database_51.png" original-image-title=""></span>

<!-- -->

3.  A knowledge article is created or updated and linked to the CI.

# Merge CI

Combine duplicate CIs into a single “master” record so relationships, history, and other references are consolidated, and you don’t manage the same asset twice.

1.  Open the CI you want to keep (the master) in CMDB.

2.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions, </span>and then select <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Merge CI</span>.  
    The <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Merge CI</span> dialog opens.

3.  Choose how to merge:

    - <span class="Strong">Merge Into</span> <span class="Emphasis">(recommended)</span> – Merge <span class="Strong">another</span> CI <span class="Strong">into the currently open</span> CI (this record stays as master).

    - <span class="Strong">Merge From</span> – Merge <span class="Strong">the current CI</span> into <span class="Strong">another</span> CI (the other record becomes master).

4.  In the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Search</span> box (or <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced Search</span>), find and select the counterpart CI to merge.

5.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span>, then confirm when prompted.

6.  The system displays a success message.

7.  The <span class="Strong">master</span> CI is retained; its <span class="Strong">Asset ID</span> and primary identity remain unchanged.

    - Where supported, <span class="Strong">relationships, references, and other mergeable data</span> from the secondary CI are consolidated into the master.

    - The <span class="Strong">secondary</span> (merged-from) CI is removed from active CMDB views and can no longer be used in operations.

# Release Hierarchy

Visualize how the current CI participates in a Release. The view lays out the end-to-end chain (CI → Release → Phase → Activity → Task). You can confirm scope, ownership, and impact without drilling through multiple records.

1.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions </span>and then Choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Release Hierarchy</span>.

    <span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/CMDB%20-%20Left-Nav/Configuration%20Management%20Database_52.png" original-image-title=""></span>

<!-- -->

2.  If your browser blocks pop-ups, allow the new tab/window.  
    The hierarchy opens in a separate tab.

3.  A read-only diagram showing nodes such as:

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">CI</span> (the record you started from)

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Release</span> (RLSxxxxx)

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Phase</span> (RPHxxxxx)

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Activity</span> (RL Axxxxx)

- <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Task</span> (RLTxxxxx)

- Lines represent the relationships between those records.

<span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Creating and Associating a Release Record with a Configuration Item (CI) in Virima ITSM</span>

To manage releases and track their impact on specific assets within Virima, follow this workflow:

1.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Navigate to the Release Section in the ITSM Module</span>  
    Begin by accessing the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Release</span> under the ITSM module. Here, you can initiate a new release record to plan and manage changes or deployments.

2.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Create a Release Record</span>  
    Fill in the required details to create a new release. This record serves as the central entity for tracking all phases, activities, and tasks related to the release process.

3.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Associate Phases, Activities, and Tasks</span>  
    Within the release record, define and link the necessary <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">phases</span> (major stages of the release), <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">activities</span> (specific actions within each phase), and <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">tasks</span> (granular work items under each activity). This hierarchical structure ensures that every step of the release is documented and traceable.

4.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Associate the Release with a Configuration Item (CI)</span>  
    Link the release to the relevant Configuration Item (e.g. <span class="Strong">AST0004</span>) by assigning it as an associated CI. This establishes a direct relationship between the release and the asset it impacts, enabling end-to-end traceability.

5.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">View Release Hierarchy from the CI Record</span>  
    After association, navigate to the CI record for <span class="Strong">AST0004</span> in the CMDB.

    - In the CI’s <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Related Records</span> or <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">ITSM</span> tab, you will see the linked release(s).

    - Use the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Release Hierarchy</span> view (accessible via the “**Select Actions**” menu inside the CI) to visualize the full structure:  
      <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">CI → Release → Phase → Activity → Task</span>  
      This read-only diagram provides a clear, end-to-end view of how the CI is involved in the release process, including all related phases, activities, and tasks.

# Rescan Now

Run an on-demand discovery against the currently open CI to refresh its attributes and components (useful after a config change or when the last scan is stale). The action triggers a single scan; it doesn’t edit data directly—updates are applied when the scan completes.

1.  Open the CI in CMDB.

2.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions,</span> and then select <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Rescan Now</span>.

    <span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/CMDB%20-%20Left-Nav/Configuration%20Management%20Database_54.png" original-image-title=""></span>

<!-- -->

3.  A <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Rescan Now</span> dialog opens.

    <span class="image placeholder" original-image-src="../Resources/Images/CMDB%20-%20Left-Nav/Configuration%20Management%20Database_55.png" original-image-title=""></span>

<!-- -->

4.  Review <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">IP Address</span> (pre-filled from the CI). Adjust only if needed.

5.  Choose a <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Client</span> from the drop down.

6.  Select the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Type of scan</span> (e.g., Certificate scan, Host Ping Scan), as supported in your environment.

7.  Click <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Scan</span>.

8.  The system automatically redirects you to the recent scan page, where you can monitor the progress and results of the scan.
