- Deleting an item is permanent and cannot be undone. Understand the potential effects before deleting an item.

- Deleting an imported Meraki Import run will remove all corresponding discovered items from both the Import from Meraki page and the Discovered Items page.

- If any discovered items from the selected Meraki Import run have already been moved to the CMDB, those records will not be deleted---they will remain in the CMDB but will no longer appear in the Import from Meraki or Discovered Items pages.
