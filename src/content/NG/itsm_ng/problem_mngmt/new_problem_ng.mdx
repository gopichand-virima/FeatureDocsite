# Create New Problem

Problem records track the root causes of incidents and help prevent future occurrences.

## When to Create a Problem

Create a problem when:
- Multiple similar incidents occur
- Root cause is unknown
- Major incident requires investigation
- Pattern of failures identified
- Workaround exists but no permanent fix

## Creating a Problem

### Method 1: From Incident

Create problem from recurring incidents:

1. Open the incident
2. Navigate to **Related Records** tab
3. Click **Create Problem**
4. System pre-fills from incident data
5. Complete additional fields
6. Click **Submit**

### Method 2: From Problem List

1. Navigate to **ITSM** > **Problem Management**
2. Click **New Problem**
3. Fill in problem details
4. Link related incidents
5. Click **Submit**

### Method 3: Proactive Problem

For proactive problem identification:

1. Identify potential issue before incidents occur
2. Create new problem record
3. Document the risk or vulnerability
4. Plan preventive actions

## Problem Form Fields

## Problem Priority

Priority determines investigation urgency:

### Critical
- Production system affected
- No workaround available
- High incident volume
- Business critical services

### High
- Important systems affected
- Workaround available but difficult
- Moderate incident volume
- Requires timely resolution

### Medium
- Standard priority
- Workaround available
- Low incident volume
- Normal investigation pace

### Low
- Minor systems affected
- Good workaround available
- Minimal impact
- Investigate when resources available

4. Notifications sent
5. Investigation can begin

## After Creation

What happens next:

1. **Automatic Actions:**
   - Problem number assigned
   - Status set to "New"
   - Workflow initiated
   - Notifications sent

2. **Investigation Phase:**
   - Root cause analysis begins
   - Data gathered
   - Testing performed
   - Findings documented

3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - Permanent fix identified
   - Change created if needed
   - Known error documented
   - Incidents updated
