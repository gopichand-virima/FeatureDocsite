# My Requests

Use this function to displays the status of requests that are created by the currently logged in user.


- Role access for Request is required.
- A Request can be canceled, but this must be done before the Request is closed.


In the navigation pane, select **Self-Service > My Requests**. The resulting window displays a list of all service catalog requests (if any).

To view the related request information, under Request ID, click the **hyperlink**. The related [Request](/itsm/request_fulfillment/requests_ng.mdx) window displays.
