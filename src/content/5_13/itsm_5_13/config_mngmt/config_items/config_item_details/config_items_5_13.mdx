# Configuration Items (CI)

Configuration Items (CI) are components or other service assets that must be managed to deliver an IT service.

In Virima:

- Each CI is derived from a Blueprint, with components that can be Network Adapters, Storage Disks, Software Instances, and so forth.
- Each CI component is associated with the parent CI using Relationships--for example, Installed On, Component Of, Hosted On, Virtualized On, and so forth.
- Each CI/CI Component in Virima has a unique Asset ID.

CI's are added when they are:

- Moved manually into CMDB.
- Discovered by the Discovery application as they are moved into CMDB.
- Imported from a file (.xls, .xlsx, or .csv).

To configure items, do the following:

In the navigation pane, select **ITSM > Configuration Management > Configuration Items**. The Configuration Items window displays.

From the *Select Actions* drop-down list, choose an action: [New](/itsm/config_mngmt/config_items/config_item_new/config_items_new_5_13.mdx), [Delete](/common_topics/delete_remove_5_13.mdx), or [Export](/discovery/import_data_files/export_5_13.mdx).
