# Import CI's

# Import CI without using existing Field Mapping Template

1. From the **Select Actions** menu, click **Import CI's**.

1. The **Attach CI Data Files** window appears, allowing you to proceed with uploading and mapping your configuration item data files.

1. In the **Attach CI Data Files** window:

  - Select a mapping type as None
  - **None** – Import without a template.
  - Click **Browse** to select a file (.xls, .xlsx, or .csv).
  - (Optional) Download the sample template for reference.

**Expected Columns & What to Enter**

- **Asset Name**  
  The name of the asset (e.g., server host + IP).

- **IP Address** (possible correlator)  
  The host's primary IP (e.g., 10.14.80.36). If your blueprint uses IP as a correlator, this helps match to an existing CI.

- **Host Name** (possible correlator)  
  Host name of the device (e.g., ADSERVERLD). Another common correlator.

- **Mac Address** (possible correlator)  
  Physical MAC address (e.g., 00:50:56:B4:01:5). Use standard notation and only one MAC per row.

- **Blueprint Name** **(Mandatory)**  
  The CMDB blueprint that defines the CI's schema (e.g., **Windows Server**). Must exactly match an existing blueprint name.

- **Asset Id** (Mandatory only for updates)  
  The CMDB ID of an **existing** CI (e.g., AST003156).

- **Acquisition Date**  
  A datetime field for asset lifecycle. **Format must be** MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (e.g., 12/22/2022 07:00:00 AM).
