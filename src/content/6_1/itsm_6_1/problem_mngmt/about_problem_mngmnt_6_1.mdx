# About Problem Management

Use this function to manage problems and identify the root cause of incidents.

Problem Management is responsible for managing the lifecycle of all Problems. The primary objectives are to prevent incidents from happening and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented.

Problem Management includes:

- Reactive Problem Management - analyzing incidents and identifying their root cause
- Proactive Problem Management - identifying and resolving problems before incidents occur
- Known Error Management - capturing and managing Known Errors
