### Breadcrumbs

When viewing an incident, a "breadcrumb" trail is shown with statuses for the incident. The statuses change based upon the type of incident. An example is shown below.

!

Actions can be taken for an item. When the text is clicked, a message displays prompting to confirm the status change should be performed.

!

Click **OK**. The appropriate next step is taken. For example, when the "Active" status is changed, the "In Progress" status changes to "Skipped." 

!

If the "Resolved" item is selected, the Resolution Notes dialog box displays.

Below is an example of how the breadcrumbs change when the "Delivery" status changes:

### Closing an Incident

When closing the Incident, the Assignee will set the *State* to **Closed** under Record Details. When **Save** is clicked, a prompt displays to enter the *Closure Notes*, which can be viewed under the Closure Information.


### Email Notifications

When certain events occur, an email notification is sent. This occurs for the following:

- Closing an incident
- Creating a Knowledge Item
- Creating a Problem
- Adding/Updating Notes
- Resolution for a Survey
- SLA Breached
- **Response and Resolution Time Violations**  
  If the First level support assignee violates the Resolution Time, the Incident is auto assigned to a Second level assignee or Second level group and an escalation email is sent to Users/Roles/From Record as defined in escalation hierarchy of Custom Timescale/Root Cause CI/Priority based Timescale.  
  
  Similarly if Second level assignee violates, the Incident is auto assigned to a Third level assignee or Third level group and an escalation email is sent to Users/Roles/From Record as defined in escalation hierarchy of Custom Timescale/Root Cause CI/Priority based Timescale.  
  
  If the Third level assignee violates then SLA breached email is sent to Users/Roles/From Record as defined in escalation hierarchy of Custom Timescale/Root Cause CI/Priority based Timescale.


### Root Cause CI

A CI will be assigned to Second and Third level support Assignees and has its own SLA (defined for all the 2 levels). When a CI is assigned to an Incident as a Root Cause CI, then the SLA and Escalation process is changed (see details below).

### **SLA Calculation**

| Root Cause CI | Blueprint of CI | SLA Calculation |

| --- | --- | --- |

| If SLA is defined | If SLA is defined | CI's SLA is considered (provided Custom Timescale is not set) |

| If SLA is not defined | If SLA is defined | Blueprint SLA is considered (provided Custom Timescale is not set) |

| If SLA is not defined | If SLA is not defined | Priority based Timescale is considered (provided Custom Timescale is not set) |


### **Assignment and Escalation Process**

If the assignees are not set in the model, then an Incident is escalated by default to Incident Manager(s).


| Root Cause CI | Blueprint of CI | SLA Calculation |

| --- | --- | --- |

| If support level users are assigned | If support level users are assigned | Incident is assigned and escalated as per CI assignees. |

| If support level assignees are not assigned | If support level assignees are assigned | Incident is assigned and escalated as per blueprint assignees. |

| If support level assignees are not assigned | If support level assign’s are not assigned | Incident is assigned and escalated as per Incident Model assignees. |


Response and Resolution Time Calculation when a Root Cause CI is assigned

Example scenario:

An Incident is created at 9:00 AM with a medium priority, and has a response time of 10 minutes (for the 1st level assignee).

At 9:03 AM, a root cause CI (which has a response time of five minutes) is associated to an Incident, the available response time would be only two minutes (that is the Response time of the CI minus the number of minutes spent before assigning the root cause CI).

If the Root Cause CI (which has a response time of three minutes) is assigned to an incident at 9:03 AM, and there is no response time left, a Response Time Violation email is sent to Incident Manager(s).
