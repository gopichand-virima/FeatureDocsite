# Audits

The **Audit** feature in CMDB allows you to verify the configuration and presence of Configuration Items (CIs).

- Click the **Select Actions** dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.
- Choose **Audits** from the dropdown.

You can perform audits by either **creating a new audit process** or **adding CIs to an existing audit**.

# Adding to an existing audit

To attach CIs to an existing audit:

1. Select the CI(s) from the CMDB.

2. Choose **Audit** from the **Select Actions** dropdown.

3. Select the **Add to Existing Audit** option.

4. Use the search bar to locate the audit.

5. Select it from the list and click **Add**.

# Creating a new audit

To initiate a new audit:

- Select one or more CI records from the CMDB.
- From the **Select Actions** dropdown, choose **Audit**.
- In the pop-up window, select **New Audit**.

- Fill in the following fields:
  - **Name**: Enter a unique name for the audit (e.g., "Java Audit").
  - **Description**: Add a brief explanation of the audit purpose.
  - **Auditor**: Assign the user(s) responsible for conducting the audit.
  - **Checked By**: Assign the user(s) responsible for reviewing the audit results.
  - **Run A Scan**: Enable this option to trigger a **probe scan** on the target CI(s).
  - **Select Probe**: Choose a specific probe to define what the scan checks.
  - **Scan Frequency**: Set how often the scan should repeat, if needed.
  - **Audit Result**: Select the outcome (e.g., Pass, Fail, In Progress).
- Click **Add** to start the audit process.

**Example**: Java Audit Scan

When you assign a **Java audit scan** to a CI, the selected probe checks whether **Java is installed** on the system.

- If Java is present, the audit result will reflect a **Pass** (or custom result).
- If Java is missing, it may show **Fail** or **In Progress**, depending on the probe response.
- The **Checked By** field allows designated users to review and verify the automated results.
