# Process DevOps

The <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Process DevOps</span> action processes selected Configuration Items (CIs) to identify, record, and update DevOps-related configuration and deployment details in the CMDB. It links CIs to relevant DevOps pipelines, repositories, environments, and automation scripts, enhancing visibility into CI/CD processes and operational dependencies.

To run the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Process DevOps</span> job, scanned discovery data must be available in the CMDB. Without this data, DevOps information cannot be processed accurately.

1.  Open the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">CMDB</span> module in Virima.

2.  Select the CIs for which you want to process DevOps data.

3.  Click the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Select Actions</span> dropdown at the top-right of the CMDB list.

4.  Choose <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Process DevOps</span> from the dropdown.

5.  The system fetches associated DevOps pipeline, repository, and environment data.

6.  It maps this data to the selected CIs in the CMDB.

7.  Updated DevOps relationships and metadata are stored in the CMDB.

8.  Verify the processed data in the CI’s details or related DevOps views.

9.  Track progress and results via the <span class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">Sync Logs</span> page if processing runs in the background.
