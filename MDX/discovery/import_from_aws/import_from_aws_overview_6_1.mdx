# Import from AWS

**Import from AWS** in Virima securely pulls resource metadata (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, VPC, etc.) from your AWS account using API credentials. Imports are reviewed in the Import AWS Window before you optionally **Move to CMDB** for selected items. Runs can be on demand or scheduled, with recurring imports keeping data current. This reduces discovery overhead, improves accuracy, and streamlines cloud visibility and management. The Import AWS Window also lets you export, delete, filter, and personalize your import records for efficient review and action.
