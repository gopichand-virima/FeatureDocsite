## Version Control

The versioning of a CI starts from Production status and thereafter increments the version by 0.1 when changes are made in the CI.

Below are the conditions that version a CI:

- Changing one or more property values of a CI.
- Adding a New Property.
- Adding a New CI component for example: adding a Software Instance or a Network Adapter etc.
- Removing a component from a CI.

If the first two conditions (mentioned above) happen for any of the CI components, the system versions the CI Component and the CI.


You cannot set a version as a baseline which was versioned due to one of its components. When a version is set as the baseline, for example, marked as stable and for this version, a snapshot is created that can be used as a revert to version.


- Click the drop-down list and choose a version.

A window displays with the current asset information.

- To set this version as the baseline, click **Set as Baseline**.
- Click **Done**.
