Quick facts about the CI:

- [Asset ID]{.Strong} -- Virima's unique identifier for the discovered CI (e.g., DSC69303). Use this to search or reference the record.

- [Blueprint]{.Strong} -- The discovery blueprint that matched the resource (e.g., *Intune Virtual Network*, *Intune Neo4j*). It indicates the CI's class/type.

- [Created On]{.Strong} -- Timestamp when the CI was first created in the CMDB from discovery.

- [Last Modified On]{.Strong} -- The most recent time the CI's data was updated (any field change or enrichment).

- [Last Seen On]{.Strong} -- The last successful discovery of assets. If this gets old, the asset may be offline or unreachable.

 - The \"Last Seen On\" field is not available for assets imported from Cloud sources.

- [IP Address]{.Strong} -- Last known IP detected for the CI (blank for types that don't expose an IP).

- [Host Name]{.Strong} -- Host/endpoint name captured by discovery (for cloud services, often the workload/task name).

- [Authorization status]{.Strong} -- A badge indicating **Authorized** or **This CI is unauthorized**:

 - [Authorized]{.Emphasis} = the CI is recognized/approved to exist in the CMDB; surfaced from Authorize tab of Import from Intune import records view.

 - An authorized asset always has an associated CMDB ID, such as \"**Update to \<CMDB Asset ID\>**\".

 - [Unauthorized]{.Emphasis} = the CI is new or not yet approved; typically surfaced from the *Unauthorized* tab in import views.

- [Tags]{.Strong} -- If any\
 Tags are Intune metadata key-value pairs attached to resources (like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.).
