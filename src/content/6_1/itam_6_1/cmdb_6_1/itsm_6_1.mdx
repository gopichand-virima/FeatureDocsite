# ITSM 

- The ITSM (IT Service Management) tab displays all ITSM records associated with a Configuration Item (CI).

- This view allows you to track the CI's involvement in service-related activities across various ITSM modules.

- This integration supports platforms like Virima, ServiceNow, Ivanti, and Jira, with toggles to filter records based on the selected source.

**Creating new ITSM records**

You can initiate a new record directly from this tab:

- Use the platform toggles (Virima, ServiceNow, Ivanti, Jira) in the ITSM tab to select the desired source for incident creation.

- If you select Virima (or another platform) and click **New Incident**, you will be redirected to the respective domain page to create a new incident.

- Enter the details, then click **Add** to create a new incident.

- The selected Configuration Item (CI) will be **automatically linked** to the new record.
